In the summer of 1972, we saw a Frankenstein movie containing a fascinating
device: a giant electrostatic generator made from spinning glass disks.  It was obviously
a non-working prop, but I designed and drew plans for a Wimshurst machine of similar size.

Jeff Hohman, Joel Trygstad and I built, sanded and stained the rugged wooden frame from 2x4 and 2x12 lumber.  Jeff bought a 4' x 8' sheet of 1/4-inch acrylic and a 3/4-inch steel axel, using our entire budget of $40.

A pair of 4-foot disks were cut out, and a pair of octagonal wooden bearings were built, bored and greased.  The bottoms of aluminum loaf pans were cut out and epoxied to the disks.

Jerry Danielson helped us obtain motors and large pulleys from broken washing machines at
his father's laudramat.  Bearings and pulleys were attached to the disks.  The collectors
and adjustable neutralizer brushes were built.

Scott Hefner and Kevin Anderson joined us.  We assembled the machine
and balanced the disks to turn without shaking.  It didn't work, and I
realized there were not enough plates to create
electrostatic-influence effect.  At that point, Kevin's father showed up, rather upset.
It was 1AM, and he was expected to get up and milk cows at 6!

Jerry and Jeff verified my theory by taping extra temporary aluminum-foil
plates to the disks.  After purchasing the entire remaining
supply of loaf pans from the local grocery, we attached 16 more plates shaped to fit between
the original set.
Then it worked, generating 100,000 volts and rapidly
firing 2-inch sparks.
