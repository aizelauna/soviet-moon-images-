<B>Dying Moon Carnival</B>
<P>
As you step onto the moldy sawdust that covers the ground of the main strip of
 the Dying Moon Carnival, you enter a world of faded magic and exposed seams.
 A ghostly breeze whistles through the gashes in the canvas of the tattered
 tents, rattling the ancient strings of colored lights and ragged streamers
 looped over the lane. Despite the evident decay, the carnival still seems to
 be open for business...to the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_Whirligig.htm">east</A>, past a decrepit gate, you hear the music
 of what might be a carousel. On the other side of the lane, slightly to the
<A HREF="Dhalgren_HouseFreaks.htm">northwest</A>, stands a faded tent bearing a sign whose peeling gilt letters proclaim
 that within is the House of Freaks.  Behind the House of Freaks, slightly to
 the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_LeCafeFetish.htm">southwest</A>, you see what might be a small building of some sort.  The lane leads
<A HREF="Dhalgren_StoneBuilding.htm">north</A> out of the carnival.
<P>
It's midday, and the bleak afternoon light shines unforgivingly upon the
 disuse and decay around you.  A dreary almost-rain is falling from the sky. 
 You feel uncomfortably damp, more clammy than wet.
