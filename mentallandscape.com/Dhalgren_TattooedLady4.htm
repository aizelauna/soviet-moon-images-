<B>The House of Freaks</B>
<P>
You ignore the Tattooed Lady. Disappointed, the Tattooed Lady shrugs
 philosophically and yawns.
Tired of your games, the Tattooed Lady is now ignoring you as well...if you
 think she's being unfair, maybe you should 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_TattooedLady0.htm">poke</A> her to get her attention.
<P>
The inside of The House of Freaks holds true to the shabby promise of the
 exterior.  It's spartan, but for the various freaks. You notice that the
 <A HREF="Dhalgren_Tank.htm">northwest</A> corner of the tent is partitioned off by a silver curtain that
 hangs in grime-streaked shreds. An unpleasant blue light seeps through a rip
 in the canvas on the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_LeCafeFetish.htm">south</A> wall. Peeling black paint marks out a doorway on
 the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_DyingMoonCarnival.htm">eastern</A> wall; in better days, the scattering of faded pink and green
 sequins lushly decorated the door-flaps in glittering stripes, and the neon
 arrow calling attention to the entrance glowed with a violet luster. The
 lacings that hold the southwest corner of the tent have partially rotted
 away, and the canvas hangs open near the ground.
