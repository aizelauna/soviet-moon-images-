<P>
Rebis waves to you.<BR>
Vampy says, "Tomorrow night Craig, Nancy, Matt, and I are going out to eat and
 then to see Ed Wood."<BR>
Rebis says, "I thought Ed Wood was a great film..."<BR>
Patroclus say, "Landau is supposed to be great as Bela Lagosi"<BR>
Vampy [to Patroclus]: When are  you coming here?<BR>
Rebis says, "Martin Landau is amazing as Bela Lugosi, yes."<BR>
Vampy leaves his terminal because he MUST change the CD..<BR>
Patroclus [to Vampy]: Hopefully early November..<BR>
Rebis waves. See you all later.<BR>
Vampy waves bye.<BR>
You sense that Rebis is looking for you in Dr Benway's Clinic.<BR>
E pages, "No problem--I'm just hanging out in Lambda too, & 2 conversations
 was too confusing."<BR>
unsung by helmet beats throughout the room.<BR>
Vampy says, "I dont have CDs or anything.. Right now I'm suffering through my
 roommate's Pet Shop Boys CD.. AAAHHHHH..."<BR>
Patroclus [to Vampy]: Matt listens to Pet Shop Boys?<BR>
Vampy [to Patroclus]: Matt's out.. But it was the CD in the machine and I was
 lazy..<BR>
Patroclus [to Vampy]: Matt's out?  Just because he listens to Pet Shop Boys, I
 wouldn't jump to conclusions.<BR>
Vampy thwacks Patro.<BR>
Patroclus ducks.

The bright light in the right-most corner reveals that the seemingly black
 walls are really dark green.  Surprisingly clean brown/tan paisley cloth
 covers the ceiling and floor.  A lone broken bottle is lying in the far left
 corner.  Along the east wall above the door there is a sign that says 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_StoneLions.htm">EXIT</A>.
