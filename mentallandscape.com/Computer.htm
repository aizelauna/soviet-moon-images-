<H2>Before My Time</H2>
Two historical computers fascinated me.  The Differential Analyzer was a mechanical analog computer constructed by visionary scientist Vannevar Bush (right).
<P>
Eckert and Mauchly's ENIAC computer was one of the first electronic digital computers.

<H2>CDC 6600</H2>
Seymour Cray started Control Data Corporation.
<P>
Nobody did timesharing as well as CDC in the 1970s.  They had
<A HREF="http://www.platopeople.com/index.html">PLATO</A>, an international network with 3D multiuser games and instant messaging ("TERM-talk").  They installed a 2000 port timesharing system for all of Minnesota's highschools in the mid '70s.  Was the ARPAnet that big then?

<H2>PDP-11/70, VAX 780</H2>
Gordon Bell at Digital Equipment Corporation fostered the minicomputer.  From 1978 to the mid 1980s, I programmed DEC's PDP-11 and VAX systems at Caltech and Bell Telephone Laboratories.
<P>
Dave Cutler wrote the VMS operating system for the VAX, but ultimate Bell Lab's UNIX system was what flourished on the minicomputer and the workstation.

<H2>Windows PC</H2>
The PC has been around for ages.  Like the mammals, it started small and lived in the shadows of the minicomputer and the unix workstation.  But after a few mass extinctions, it has become the dominant form of computer today.
<P>
With its wide-spread acceptance, the PC has created a social revolution as well as providing the incentive for radically improved performance per dollar.
