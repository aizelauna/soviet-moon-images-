S.A. Afanas'ev was Minister of General Machine Building from 1965 to 1983.
As such, he was the manager of a one million man workforce dedicated to the production of satellites, spacecraft, launch vehicles and ballistic missiles.
The Soviet space program was directed by powerful individuals including Afanas'ev, Korol&#235;v, Babakin, Glushko.
Intimidating and rude,
Afanas'ev was admired by some for his ability to orchestrate enormous projects, and accused by others of not embracing new technologies.
Afanas'ev criticized OKB-1's quality-control and was involved in the termination their manned moon-landing effort.
So important was his organization to the defense of the Soviet Union, Premier Brezhnev told him, 'We believe in you, but if you fail, we will put you against a brick wall and shoot you.'

V.S. Avduevskii graduated from the Moscow Aviation Institute and worked on high speed aerodynamics and heat transfer at the Central Institute of Aviation Motors, the Keldysh Research Center, and the Center for Nonlinear and Wave Mechanics.
He was an expert on aerodynamics and thermal processes of warhead and spacecraft reentry and on ablative heat shield materials.
Avduevskii was involved in the design of heat-shields for the Venera landers, which had to employ materials that would retain thermal insulation properties under high pressure and temperature.
He proposed atmospheric models for Venus based on the thermodynamic analysis of temperature, pressure, density and aerodynamic drag characteristics of the landers.

G.N. Babakin was one of the most respected designers in the Soviet space program.
At NII-88 and OKB-301, he worked on surface-to-air missile targeting and control systems.
OKB-301 was named after its late director, Lavochkin, and Babakin became its new head.
In 1965, Korol&#235;v assigned Babakin and his bureau to develope all lunar and planetary probes.
Applying sound quality-control methodology, this marked the beginning of success after success.
Babakin's team designed and built Luna-9 to Luna-24, performing the first lunar landing, first lunar satellite, automated sample returns, and robotic surface rovers.
Venera-4 was their first Venus mission, and the first <I>in situ</I> probe of another planet.
They built the M-69 Mars probes (destroyed in launch mishaps), and Babakin oversaw the design of the second generation spacecraft and landers (Mars-2, Venera-9). Sadly, he did not survive to see those missions carried out.
A crater on the Moon and one on Mars are named after him.

K.P. Florenskii was one of the Soviet Union's foremost planetary geologists. He joined Vernadskii's institute of geochemistry in 1935, working with its namesake and with A.P. Vinogradov.
In 1958, he led an expedition to study the site of the 1908 explosion in Tunguska Siberia, believed caused by a meteor or comet impact.
In later years, he studied meteor impacts and their consequences on the geology and atmosphere of planets.
In the early 1960s, he planned some of the first experiments to chemically analyze the atmosphere of Venus.
In 1967, Vinogradov asked him to organize a Department of Lunar Geology at IKI, where his team worked on landing site selection for manned and robotic missions.  In 1975, his lab returned to the Vernadskii Institute.
He was involved in the study of the rock samples returned by Luna-16,20,24 and planned remote experiments on the Lunokhod rovers.
Florenskii developed theories of planetary geology and interpreted the imagery from the Mars-5 orbiter and the Venera-9 lander.
A crater on the Moon is named after him.

K.I. Gringauz
was the first to measure the Solar Wind, which at the time was a controversial new theory.
In the late 1940s, Gringauz used ground-based radio interferometry and phase-locked radio transmission from rockets, to study electron density of the ionosphere.
He built the dual-frequency radio transmitter for Sputnik-1.
Ion traps onboard Sputnik-3 measured the energy spectrum of interplanetary plasma,
and similar devices on Luna-1 and Luna-2 detected the constant flow of solar plasma.
Experiments on Venera-1 and Mars-1 verified the existence of this flow throughout the solar system, and helped to map the structure of the Earth's plasmasphere.
Gringauz' plasma sensors became part of the canonical set of remote sensors onboard virtually all Soviet spacecrafts, including the Vega encounters with Halley's comet.

A.M. Isaev was a leading rocket-motor engineer and head of the Chemical Machine-Building (KhimMash) Design Bureau.
During the 1940s, he developed more efficient designs for combustion chambers and fuel injection.
In 1950, Isaev began the research and development of the first close-cycle rocket engines, in which partial combustion of fuel drives the fuel and oxidizer turbine pumps.
He also solved one of the most difficult and dangerous problems in rocket motors, a dampening system to prevent self-induced oscillation in the combustion chamber.
Another unique design from KhimMash, used in some Soviet ICBM's, was the immersion of the rocket motor directly in the liquid propellant tank.
For project MV, the first planetary probe, Isaev agreed to build the mid-course correction system. Venera-1 to Venera-8 all contained his KDU-414 engine, the next generation of Mars and Venus probes used the more powerful KTDU-425, and
his team built the landing retrorockets for Luna-9 to Luna-24.
A crater on the far side of the Moon is named after him.

He used radio frequency mass spectrometers to probe the ionosphere with geophysical rockets, and in 1963 discovered the presence of metal ions originating from vaporized micrometeorites.
Istomin's mass spectrometer on Sputnik-3 was the first to be flown on a spacecraft.
While at the Space Research Institute (IKI),
he designed experiments to analyze the mass spectra of the Martian and Venusian atmospheres on the descent vehicles of Mars-3, Mars-6 and Venera-11 to Venera-14.
Mass spectrometry on satellites (such as Kosmos-1809) investigated the composition of the ionosphere, which contains many exotic ion species.

G.Iu. Maksimov joined OKB-1 in 1957 and was soon regarded as one of the most brilliant intellects of the Soviet space program.
Impressed by his initial design concepts, Korol&#235;v placed Maksimov in charge of the development of the Luna-1, Luna-2 and Luna-3 probes.
After their success, Korol&#235;v asked Maksimov to study the problem of sending spacecraft to Venus and Mars.
Maksimov showed that by launching from orbit, the planetary payload could be increased from 200 kg to 1000 kg, and he successfully argued that planetary probes must carry high-gain antennas and course-correction engines. His team designed the first Mars and Venus probes, 1M and 1VA (Venera-1), which were the first to embody all these features of the modern spacecraft.
Following the experiences and lessons of Venera-1, Maksimov began the design of a standardized MV (Mars/Venus) probe, which would be the template for planetary spacecrafts for the next ten years, from Mars-1 to Venera-8.
His team also designed the E-6 spacecraft, which began attempts at Lunar soft landing in 1963.
Maksimov designed a never-built heavy interplanetary vehicle (TMK) which included nuclear reactors, ion engines and hothouses for growing vegetation and regenerating the atmosphere.
After planetary probe design was transferred to Lavochkin, Maksimov joined the Space Research Institute (IKI) in 1968, where he received a candidate degree (PhD). In 1975, he joined VNIIEM, and he taught at the Moscow High Technical School (MVTU).
