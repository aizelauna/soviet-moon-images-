<H3>Consciousness</H3>
I had a long talk with Feynmann once about "consciousness".  I proposed
that consciousness was extremely interesting because it is the only
observed experience that seems to transcend physical laws.  That is,
our mental activity is a chemical and electrical process, awareness
seems unnecessary and supernatural.
<P>
He was very cautious about the use of undefined but evocative words
like "mind" and "consciousness".  He said that people seem at first to
have a common definition, but when you really try to talk with someone
about consciousness, you discover that their personal definition is
different from your own.
<P>
He had long arguments with his son about this.  His son believed that
the word "consciousness" was sort of trivial, just meaning "awake".  He
perversely refused to accept any deeper meaning of the word.
<P>
Feynmann thought that people just learned to manipulate this word, as
they acquired language, and perhaps it is meaningless -- maybe.  But he
did think there was something paradoxical and very interesting about
the word.
<P>

<H3>Red and Blue Electrons</H3>
I sat in on a second-term
course on Field Theory.  I would say that
Feynmann was a bit moody and some days he seemed well prepared, and
other days he would wonder out loud if he should just cancel the
course.  He seemed to feel frustrated, like he was trying to get
something across that wasn't sinking in.
<P>
One day as usual, here was a
huge expression on the board, and students were suggesting changes to
try to fit it to some set of properties.  Someone would say "what
if we added an S squared term", and Feynmann would instantly say "Now that's
interesting, if there were an S-squared term, then such-and-such would
happen, and something-or-other wouldn't be conserved".  One student
insisted that a change he suggested was OK.  Feynmann was annoyed
because the student was being formal without making a connection to
physics.  The student was saying something about a property of some
matrix, and Feynmann said loudly (switching characteristically to a New
York accept with poor grammer) "I don't give a damn if the matrix is
hermitian.  That change would add another quantum number to the
electron.  Now you got red electrons and blue electrons, and with that
extra degree of freedom, there would be an observable change in the
thermodynamics of matter."
<P>
So, he was quick.  Obviously, he had already gone over all these
possibilities.  He would pace up and down in front of the blackboard,
flipping a piece of chalk nervously and hitching up his pants now and
then.
<P>

<H3>How To Solve Unsolvable Problems</H3>
The best lecture I recall started out with Feynmann suggesting that
he stop the course, because it wasn't really getting anyplace.  Then
he decided to talk about what he was doing right then, as an example of
real research.  He was interested in quantum chromodynamics, and the
big frustration at the time was that people had a theory, but it was
too difficult to evaluate it and predict numerical results of
experiments.
<P>
He explained that in cases like this, it was hard to know where to
start.  He wanted to "understand" aspects of the theory, and develop
intuition.  For example, asymptotic confinement (quarks seem to bind
together more tightly as you pull them apart).
<P>
He told us that he approaches these issues by rehearsal.  'Think of a
simpler problem that seems similar.  If you can't solve that, think of
a simpler one.  If you can solve it, then SOLVE IT.  Don't just say you
know how to solve it.  After that, you might think of a way to attack
the harder problem.  You might realize something.' Basically, keep
poking around and give your intuition a chance to develop and wait for
ideas to pop into your head.
<P>
He suggested looking at an hydrogen atom in 2D.  He noted
that in that case, there was an infinite ionization energy, all the
states were bound.  He did some of the work on the board with class
participation (and people occasionally yelling out minor corrections to
his math).  Everyone was very excited and eager.  He computed the
energy levels.  Then he computed the width of the energy bands.  They
overlapped!  What did that mean?  Was the energy really quantized, or
did it behave like a continuum then?  It was amazing that such a
trivial problem would quickly lead to a mystery.
<P>
He ended the lecture by charging everyone with the task of "learning
something new about two dimensions" that they could report to the
class.  "Anything new.  I don't care how trivial it is." And he meant
"anything".  He wasn't the least bit afraid to do something trivial,
but maybe with a different viewpoint.  Then show it to people with
delight.  He wasn't the least bit afraid to ask a dumb question at a
talk--often a question that lots of other people wanted to ask.
<P>

<H3>The Use of Notebooks</H3>
Feynman told us a few times to keep notebooks.  When working on a hard problem,
spend hours of concentrated time.  People who don't think for hours without
interruption cannot solve hard problems in his opinion.  When you stop,
try to save your mental state in the notebook.  Learn to write notes that
allow you to pick up your train of thought.  In this way, days of sustained
thought could be brought to bear on an extremely hard problem.
<P>
I've never met a "genius" of the style you sometimes see in movies,
who had an effortless, super-human intelligence.  There are glib people who seem
to talk that talk, but they are fakes.  The great scientists I've met worked hard,
and Feynman stated explicitly that you had to work and be methodical to
make substantial discoveries.
<P>

<H3>The World's Smartest Man</H3>
At one of the weekly Physics Colloquia, Feynman came in carrying an issue of
<CITE>OMNI</CITE> magazine.  They had just interviewed him, and he thought the
magazine was kind of cool.  Then the issue with him in it appeared on the news stands,
a big picture of his face on the cover and the title, "World's Smartest Man".  This
bothered Feynman, who didn't really like that kind of talk.  To add to the weirdness,
there was a companion article about the world's smartest woman, someone from MENSA who had scored over 200 on an IQ test.
Feynman enjoyed pointing out that his IQ was very modest, like 120-something.
Of course, people into puzzles and IQ tests can practice their score up to very high levels, which then means absolutely nothing.
