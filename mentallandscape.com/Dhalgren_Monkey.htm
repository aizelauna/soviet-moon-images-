You wonder about this monkey.<BR>
...The monkey wonders about you.<BR>
You wave to the monkey.<BR>

<P>
A snow-covered concrete path runs 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_ClearingPark.htm">east</A> and 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_StoneLions.htm">west</A> through a peaceful and
 startlingly beautiful orchard of nutmeg trees.  A canopy of leaves arches
 over several benches of cedarwood.  The trees are laden with sweet yellow
 nutmeg fruit, and some green 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_Monkey.htm">monkeys</A> play in the upper branches.  Paper
 lanterns have been lit and hung from some of the trees.
<P>
You notice a faded small sign by the path.  It reads, "Please do not feed,
 pet, annoy, harass or kick the animals."  A narrow path leads south.
