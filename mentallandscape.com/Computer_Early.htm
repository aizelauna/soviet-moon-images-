The differential analyzer was a mechanical analog computer, built during the 1930s.  Input and output functions were drawn or read off of charts.  The four windowed cabinets contained mechanical integrators.  Running down the center was a bed of rotating shafts ("bus rods") that interconnected the I/O tables with the integrators.  Gears allowed the shaft rotations to be multiplied or added together.
<P>
The torque amplifier was a key invention.  Mechanical integrators contain a knife-edge disk that rolls against a polished glass plate, and that tiny force must subsequently drive the bus rods.  The amplifer was similar to a ship's capstan, the input torque tightening a cable wound around a motor driven drum.

Built in 1946 by J P. Eckert and John Mauchly, the ENIAC was an electronic, digital computer.  It was not a stored-program machine, however.  Patch panels were used to set up a data-flow program between arithmetic, loop-iteration and logical units.  ENIAC contained about 18,000 vacuum tubes and operated at 1000 Hz.
<P>
Eckert and Mauchly later formed UNIVAC Corporation, the first commercial computer vender.
