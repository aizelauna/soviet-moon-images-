Generic Edible Object (#101):
----
The Generic Edible Object (GEO) is the simplest of a class of edible,
 feelable, smellable objects.  After making a child of this object, you set
 the following messages:

   smell_msg          - what player reads when he does "smell (object)"
   taste_msg          - what player reads when he does "taste (object)"
   feel_msg           - what player reads when he does "feel (object)"
   eat_msg            - what player reads when he does "eat (object)"
   drink_msg          - what player reads when he does "drink (object)"
   smoke_msg
   
   osmell_msg         - what others see when player smells the object.
   otaste_msg                  etc, etc...
   ofeel_msg
   oeat_msg
   odrink_msg
   osmoke_msg
   
   delayed_eat_msg    - delayed action after eating, drinking or smoking.

If delayed_eat_msg is a string, it will be displayed to the player after 12
 seconds.  If it is a list of strings, randomly selected strings will be
 displayed to the user starting in 12 seconds and spaced 15 seconds apart.  In
 that case, the number of messages shown will be the square root of the length
 of the list of strings.  The chances of seeing a duplicate are then fairly
 rare.

GEO is a child of Dred's Generic Boomerang Object.  See help for that generic
 to set automatic return-to-home behavior for edible objects.

You are in a narrow dark alley way between two brick buildings. The ground is
 littered with trash, old newspapers, empty cans, bricks set up as a fireplace
 with an arrangement of pipes over it. Beside it is an army messpan, inside
 filled with dirty snow and ice. At the east end of the alley is a fence,
