<B>The Tank</B>

<B>melusina</B><BR>
A sullen-eyed bleached blonde in her early twenties. She makes her living as
 the Amazing Serpent Woman in a perpetually failing carnival.  Her hair is
 cropped close to her skull, to accommodate the blue nylon mermaid wig that
 dangles from her left hand. If you look at her closely, you'll notice the
 many silver earrings and the pierced navel...but then again, if you look at
 her that closely, she might do something extremely unpleasant to you.  You
 see a perfect tattoo of a small spiral on her left bicep.  Just having come
 from work, melusina wears a silver lame' bra on her pale torso, and her legs
 are encased in a papier mache' serpent's tail.<BR>
She is sleeping.

The home of The Amazing Serpent Woman, the star attraction of The House of
 Freaks. The tent walls are adorned with plastic seaweed, interspersed with
 styrofoam starfish in assorted neon colors, scraps of chainlink fencing, and
 pages torn from an old A.S. Byatt novel.  The focal point of this makeshift
 room is the large glass tank where
