Generic Scorpion Player Class (#153):
----
The Generic Scorpion Player Class (GSPC) implements some basic themely
 features for players on Dhalgren MOO.  "Scorpions" are members of youth gangs
 who wear holographic light shields (in Delaney's book).  Features include:

 - look notification
 - carried objects with worn_msgs are integrated into the player's desc.
 - movable_msg == NO makes player unmovable by others.
 - remote_see_msg == YES allows players not in the same room to look at you.

<P>
You see an old wooden box with a broken lid.<BR>

You are in a narrow dark alley way between two brick buildings. The ground is
 littered with trash, old newspapers, empty cans, bricks set up as a fireplace
 with an arrangement of pipes over it. Beside it is an army messpan, inside
 filled with dirty snow and ice. At the east end of the alley is a fence,
