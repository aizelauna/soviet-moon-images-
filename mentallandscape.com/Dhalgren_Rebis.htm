<B>Rebis</B><BR>
Rebis is the strange conjunction in one body of three entities: a female
 human, a male human, and a mysterious negative energy being. A greenish glow
 escapes from behind tightly-wrapped bandages that swathe em from head to
 foot. E wears fashionable high-heeled boots, and sunglasses float a few
 inches before eir eyes. As you might expect, Rebis tends to be withdrawn,
 brooding, and self-obsessed at times, but e still likes to laugh and make
 atrocious puns. A dedicated postmodern, e believes that passion and irony are
 indissociable.<BR>
E is awake and on his feet.
