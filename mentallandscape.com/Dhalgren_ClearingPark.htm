<B>Clearing In The Park</B>
<P>
You are standing in a large clearing in the park.  There is a fountain here,
 some picnic tables, and the ground is covered with a number of bedrolls and
 sleeping bags.  This seems to be a place where anyone is free to make their
 home.  A cinderblock furnace has been erected in the middle of the clearing. 
 A fire is burning in it.  It melts a patch of snow around it.  A gravel path
 extends to the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_StoneBuilding.htm">east</A> and 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_NutmegOrchard.htm">west</A>.  To the north are some public restrooms.
<P>
The steady beat of music can be heard from the southwest, beyond a hill. To
 the south, through a tangle of chokecherry and barrier wire, you see an
 abandoned road running east to west.
