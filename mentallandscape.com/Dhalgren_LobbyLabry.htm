<B>Lobby of Labry Apartments</B>
<P>
You are standing in the lobby of what might have once been an exclusive
 apartment building. The stale air is redolent with the mingled aromas of old
 chinese food and cat piss.  The walls are dingy, paint faded to a dirty grey,
 rusty stains on the cracked plaster. Someone has ornamented the walls here
 and there with words scrawled in thick black marker, but the light emitted by
 the single bulb hanging from the watermarked ceiling is too dim for you to
 decipher the letters.  The grungy white tile floor of the lobby is mostly
 covered by a filthy crimson carpet, dotted with cigarette burns and
 unpleasant stains, curling up at the edges where it doesn't quite meet the
 walls.  
<P>
The carpet stretches out unevenly to the east, disappearing into the gloom of
 a narrow hallway.  Formerly grand double 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_Broadway.htm">doors</A> hang unevenly on their hinges.   It looks like someone has
 arranged a bunch of debris into some kind of dwelling to the south.
