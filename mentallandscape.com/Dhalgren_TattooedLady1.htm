<B>The House of Freaks</B>
<P>
You peer at the Tattooed Lady. The Tattooed Lady peers back suspiciously.
<P>
You avoid the Tattooed Lady's eye and lean in for a closer look. The blue
 smudges appear to be some sort of miniscule writing...as you squint in an
 effort to make out what the characters are, you catch sight of a larger
 string of letters spiraling out from her left nipple and encircling her
 breast: 'Hereon, the entire contents of a mystical book once known as The
 Oxford English Dictionary.' Be warned...the Tattooed Lady takes herself very
 seriously, and she's already suspicious of you...it would be unwise to 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_TattooedLady2.htm">mock</A>
 her at this point.
<P>
The inside of The House of Freaks holds true to the shabby promise of the
 exterior.  It's spartan, but for the various freaks. You notice that the
 <A HREF="Dhalgren_Tank.htm">northwest</A> corner of the tent is partitioned off by a silver curtain that
 hangs in grime-streaked shreds. An unpleasant blue light seeps through a rip
 in the canvas on the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_LeCafeFetish.htm">south</A> wall. Peeling black paint marks out a doorway on
 the 
<A HREF="Dhalgren_DyingMoonCarnival.htm">eastern</A> wall; in better days, the scattering of faded pink and green
 sequins lushly decorated the door-flaps in glittering stripes, and the neon
 arrow calling attention to the entrance glowed with a violet luster. The
 lacings that hold the southwest corner of the tent have partially rotted
 away, and the canvas hangs open near the ground.
