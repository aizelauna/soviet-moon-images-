Generic Post-Apocalypse Room (#110):
----
The Generic Post-Apocalypse Room Class (PARC) allows room descriptions and
 details to depend on the time of day and the weather.  It has eight settable
 messages:

 day_msg       - substituted for %daytime in the room description
                 during the hours of 9am to 6pm.
 evening_msg   - substituted for %daytime from 6pm to 9pm.
 night_msg     - substituted for %daytime from 9pm to 6am.
 morning_msg   - substituted for %daytime from 6am to 9am.

 cool_msg      - substituted for %weather in the room description
                 when the weather is cool.
 warm_msg      - substituted for %weather when it is warm.
 raining_msg   - substituted for %weather when it is warm and raining.
 snowing_msg   - substituted for %weather when it is cold and snowing.

%weather is substituted first, then %daytime.  So the weather messages can
 contain %daytime.
Time of day messages are useful indoors and out.  Weather messages are most
 often used in outdoor rooms, but an indoor room's description could contain a
 sentence like:

   Through an open window, %daytime %weather.

Which, given the right message definitions, could result in:

   Through an open window, the night-time sky is silhouetted by a snow-covered
 fire escape.

PARC also supports basic details that can be looked at:

 @det*ail <name> is <string>   - add or replace a detail description
 @rmd*etail <name>             - remove a detail
 @details                      - show all the detail names

Note that detail strings can contain %weather and %daytime.  It is often wise
 to keep the associated time and weather messages simple (like their default
 values) so they can be useful in a variety of detail strings as well as in
 the room description.
PARC is a child of the Generic Ambient Noise Room, so see also: help #176

Generic Ambient Noise Room (#176):
----
Settable properties:

.amb_delay - this is the delay between random announcements, in seconds.
             The default is 5 minutes, or 300 seconds.
.amb_noise - this is the list of random messages you wish to display.
.active    - set to 1 (default) when runs. Set to 0 to turn off ambient noise
             behavior entirely.

All you need to do is @notedit the .amb_noise property and enter in all
 possible messages you want announced. The order doesn't matter.

Then, whenever a player enters, the announcements will start and appear every
 .amb_delay seconds. If the .amb_noise property is empty, nothing will happen
 and the room will act like a normal blank room would.
Note - the first noise message appears 30 seconds after the first player
 enters.
----
Commands:

@restart

The owner of the room can call this verb to restart the ambient noise tasks.
 Mostly in the case when .active was set to 0 for a while, then set back to 1
 while there are people still in the room.

You are in a narrow dark alley way between two brick buildings. The ground is
 littered with trash, old newspapers, empty cans, bricks set up as a fireplace
 with an arrangement of pipes over it. Beside it is an army messpan, inside
 filled with dirty snow and ice. At the east end of the alley is a fence,
