<H3>Preface</H3>
<P>
I became interested in Nikola Tesla several years ago, in
1970, while working on a large Tesla coil with some friends. I had heard that
the Tesla coil was invented in an early attempt to transmit power by
radio, but this was dismissed as the futile experiment of some-turn-of-the-century scientist who had no real understanding of radio. About a year later,
I obtained a copy of <CITE>Prodigal Genius: The Life of
Nikola Tesla</CITE> by John J. O'Neill. This is generally considered to be
the best biography, although there are half a dozen others that I know of.
Like anyone who reads this book, I was fascinated by Tesla's life and
accomplishments; in particular, by this work in Colorado Springs.
Unfortunately, there was no technical description of the equipment that Tesla
used except for some speculation that was totally false. I have never been
able to find any book or person who knew any technical details of the
wireless power system he was testing in Colorado, but I did know that it was
not as naive as a radio wave system. (Naturally radio would not be a
practical means of power distribution since it is subject to the inverse
square law.) This report is the outcome of a very careful study of early
photographs, articles, patents and books and contains as much technical
detail as I could find. It is still very incomplete, but unfortunately,
little information exists on Tesla. After Tesla's death in 1943, several
trunks of papers, records and equipment were removed from his room. These papers
are now in the Nikola Tesla Museum in Belgrade, Yugoslavia. To my knowledge, scientists
from this country have never studied them. [DPM - some of these notes were published in 1978]
<H3>Introduction</H3>
<P>
Nikola Tesla was born on July 10, 1856 and died on January
7, 1943 [1]. During his lifetime, the technology of modern radio and electric
power was born. Tesla made many important contributions in these fields. The
most important and the most famous of these was the invention of polyphase
current. This allowed practical distribution of electricity for long distances
and enabled efficient electric motors. He developed generators,
transformers, and motors both of polyphase and split phase. Today these
inventions literally turn the wheels of industry. 
<P>
Tesla knew that the world would need more and more power if it was to
advance, and he devoted his life to developing new means of producing and
distributing power. The most fascinating project that Tesla conceived was a
plan for transmitting electricity without wires. This project took up more
than twenty years of his life and was never completed successfully. However,
the discoveries that Tesla made during this time almost led to the creation
of a global radio network decades before the present one was first
established. 
<H3>Invention of the &quot;Tesla Coil&quot;</H3>
<P>
Tesla's first work with high frequency electricity began
in 1889 [2]. A year earlier, he had received $1,000,000 from George
Westinghouse for his polyphase patents, and with this, he planned to begin
researching new ideas. Tesla occupied the entire fourth floor of a six-story
building at 33 and 35 South Fifth Avenue in New York City [3]. 
<P>
Ever since 1887, when Heinrich Hertz had discovered radio waves, Tesla had
been fired with the ambition to explore the range of frequency between his
alternating current and the extremely high frequency vibrations of light [4].
<P>
By 1890, he had made a great deal of progress. His first experiments were
with a unique new high frequency alternator [5]. This was made up of a steel
disk 30 inches in diameter with 384 poles like the teeth of a cog that had
zigzag windings on them. This disk revolved within a fixed ring that had 384
inductor poles. When this machine was turned at 3000 rpm, it produced about
200 volts at 9600 to 10,000 Hz. Tesla was the first man to work with such a
device [6]. Later machines of somewhat different design produced up to 30,000
Hz. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig01.jpg" alt="High Frequency Alternator">
</CENTER>
<P>
With these alternators, Tesla discovered the basic principles of tuning.
Although electrical resonance was known at that time, it was primarily a theory
that rarely manifested itself. However, at the high frequencies that Tesla
was using, the devices would not function unless tuned to resonance. In
experiments with the alternators, he made use of induction coils to step up
the voltage. At first, ordinary coils were used, but Tesla soon found that by
removing the iron core, he could improve the output of the coils. In some
instances, the coils were immersed in boiled linseed oil for insulation.
Tesla may have been the first electrical engineer to use this now common
technique for insulating high voltage. 
<P>
Using partially evacuated glass tubes, Tesla began extensive investigation
of lighting systems using fluorescent tubes much like modern neon lights.
This was not original work at that time, but several discoveries were
made during these investigations. Tesla was well aware of the heating effects
of high frequency currents and fields, and in 1891, he became the first man
to suggest the use of radio frequency warming for therapeutic purposes [7]. 
<P>
Tesla was not satisfied with the alternator and wanted a more powerful and
less cumbersome source of current that could produce higher frequencies.
Although the alternator could produce sufficient current for Tesla's experiments,
it was very unreliable as Tesla stated in the following section of an article
on alternators: 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"The writer will incidentally
mention that anyone who attempts for the first time to construct such a
machine will have a tale of woe to tell. He will first start out as a matter
of course, by making an armature with the required number of polar
projections. He will then get the satisfaction of having produced an
apparatus which is fit to accompany a thoroughly Wagnerian opera. It may
besides possess the virtue of converting mechanical energy into heat in
nearly perfect manner [8]."
</BLOCKQUOTE>
For a more reliable power source, Tesla took advantage of
the fact that when a capacitor discharges through a coil, the energy
oscillates rapidly back and forth between them. This formed the basis of the
Disruptive Discharge Coil, or as it is known today, the Tesla Coil. 
<P>
In this device, a high voltage induction coil or transformer charges a
bank of leyden jars or other high voltage condenser. When the voltage on the
condenser builds up to a high enough level, it discharges through a spark gap
and a primary coil. The current oscillates at a frequency that may be several
million Hertz. A large secondary coil is energized by the primary coil and
reaches very high voltages. These first coils were of the same type used with
the alternators. They produced arcs about five inches long, indicating a voltage
of about 100,000 V was being produced [9]. 
<P>
In the years of 1891 through 1893, Tesla gave many lectures in America and
Europe on his work with alternating current [10]. At these, he demonstrated
most of the basic equipment necessary for wireless telegraphy, such as tuned
and coupled free oscillating circuits, the choke coil, and rotary and series
spark gapes. [DPM - quenched gaps, these open the circuit quickly when oscillation dies down, so the condenser can start recharging.]
<H3>First Work on Wireless Power</H3>
<P>
Tesla, having invented the method of transmitting power
long distances on wires, seemed to want to out do himself when he became
fascinated by wireless power. In 1892, just after returning from a European
lecture tour, he decided to experiment with long-range power transmission
[11]. Actually he had done some very interesting experiments long before then
that probably led up to this. 
<P>
One of the earliest experiments that he performed at his lectures with
wireless power was to set up two large metal plates about 18 feet apart. On a
table between these plates were some of his glass tube lamps. When the plates
were connected to a powerful oscillator, the tubes lit up. Tesla first
demonstrated this in November of 1890 [12]. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig03.jpg" alt="Room Energizing Coil">
</CENTER>
<P>
In Tesla's laboratory, a similar effect was demonstrated using dynamic
magnetic fields instead of electric fields. Built in 1892, the workshop
itself was a room 40 feet wide and 80 feet long, with a 12-foot ceiling.
Around this room, Tesla ran a cable that was connected to an oscillator [13].
Secondary coils place in the room would spout sparks when the loop was
energized and tuned to their resonant frequency. (See: above) 
<P>
Although these experiments were amazing for that time, they did not offer
a means of transmitting power, and Tesla knew it. They were simply induction
effects on a very large scale. Tesla's first announcement of a possible plan
for wireless broadcasting was made in a lecture delivered before the Franklin
Institute in Philadelphia on February of 1893 and before the National
Electric Light Association in St. Louis on March of the same year [14]. The
lecture was entitled &quot;Light and other High-Frequency Phenomena.&quot; In
this lecture, a part was included on resonance. 
<P>
Tesla showed that by using a circuit tuned to resonance, and using very
high frequency, only a single wire was necessary for carrying power, with no
need for a return conductor. In doing this, a light or special radio frequency
motor would be connected with one terminal to the oscillator and the other to
a large metal plate. 
<P>
After demonstrating this, Tesla suggested that since only one conductor
was needed for high frequency, then possibly the earth could be used as that
conductor. By learning the resonant frequency of the earth, the transmission
of intelligence or even power could be possible. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig02.jpg" alt="Early Wireless Power Concept">
</CENTER>
<P>
In the above diagram used in the lecture, an oscillator <b>S</b> is
connected to an elevated plate <b>P</b>, which acts as a reservoir of
electricity (condenser), and the ground, which would also act as a reservoir.
Any electrical disturbance would create an effect or change in potential in
the earth, which could be detected within a certain radius. However, what
this radius would be is very hard to tell. Tesla had no idea of what the
electrical properties of a huge sphere like the earth would be. 
<P>
Tesla suggested the use of a trial and error method of finding the earth's
natural period of vibration (if it had one at all). This could be done by
using an oscillator of very great power and trying different frequencies to
see which one would cause the greatest effect on the surrounding ground. 
<P>
Since the density of the charge would be very small when distributed over
the earth, there would not be much loss, and in theory as Tesla stated:
&quot;It would not require a great amount of energy to produce a disturbance
perceptible at great distances, or even all over the surface of the globe.&quot;
[15] 
<P>
Tesla later explained the problem of finding the resonant frequency of the
earth. What he had to know was whether the earth behaved like a conductor of
finite dimension or as an infinite conductor. He believed that the earth
would act much like a wire would in carrying radio frequency electric waves.
If the earth acted like an infinite conductor, no resonance effects would
exist. As in a wire of infinite length, the waves would travel along the wire
with no reflection and no build-up of power. If this were the case with the
earth, Tesla's transmitter would create local vibrations that would vanish
and fade into the distance. 
<P>
However, if the earth acted like a finite conductor, it would have a
resonant frequency. The current would travel along the earth until it reached
the opposite side and was reflected back. On its way back, the waves would
interfere with the oncoming waves and produce interference. If the distance from the transmitter to the opposite side of
the earth were equal to one half of the wavelength of the disturbance or any
multiple of that, the waves would completely cancel out. If though, the
distance is equal to one-quarter wave length or any odd multiple of it, the
waves would add together, and a state of resonance would exist. 
<P>
Naturally, Tesla knew that the earth was finite, but it could have acted
as an infinite body due to resistance and its curvature, which might have
absorbed the waves before they could be reflected. 
<P>
The first step toward discovering these facts was to build an oscillator
of sufficient strength to disturb the earth's electrostatic equilibrium.
Since Tesla did not keep many notes on his experiments, very little is known
about the details of his research. It is known, though, that in the latter
part of 1892, he made an important discovery. Up to that time, the disruptive
discharge coils bore little resemblance to the well-known Tesla Coils of
today. This was because they were built much like regular induction coils,
with a multilayered spool for the secondary and the primary wrapped around
it. The power and voltage of these devices was limited to the insulation
possible with such a configuration. 
<P>
Tesla found that by making a large coil with a single layer of wire on the
secondary, extremely high tension could be produced with ease. Tesla called
this the Quarter Wave Coil because the length of wire in the secondary coil
was about equal to a fourth of the wavelength of the oscillation it produced
[16]. The primary coil, which is only a few turns of heavy cable, is at the
base of the secondary and very loosely coupled to it. The base of the
secondary is grounded and voltage develops at the upper terminal instead of
both ends as in earlier coils. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig04.jpg" alt="Quarter Wave Coil">
</CENTER>
<P>
Using a conical coil, Tesla developed 1,000,000 volts in the spring of
1893 [17]. This coil can be seen in the first photograph (above). A
transformer of very high voltage powered it. The condenser is a bank of 32
leyden jars, which can be seen to the left and right of the coil in two banks
of 16 each [18]. The spark gap can be seen to the left of the coil. This was
a &quot;quenched gap&quot; made up of a long row of thick copper disks
stacked together with small spaces between for the spark. [DPM - a series gap] Behind the coil is
an oscillator of the older type, immersed in a wooden oil tank. An ebonite
sheet between the two high-tension terminals prevented corona lose. 
<P>
In 1893, Tesla was involved with Mr. Westinghouse in the design and
installation of generators of the polyphase type in a amazing new power
plant at Niagara falls [19]. Later in 1894, the Worlds Fair was to be
illuminated by alternating current, and both Tesla and Westinghouse were very
busy with this [20]. Tesla was given a personal exhibit there, where he
demonstrated his AC motors and some of his high frequency discoveries. 
<H3>The Second New York Laboratory</H3>
<P>
In 1895, on March 13, Tesla was felled by a great tragedy [21]. The six
story building in which his laboratory was located burned down. The fourth
floor, where his equipment was, collapsed down to the second floor and all
his machinery was destroyed. None of it was insured. His lecture equipment,
notes, photographs, and his famous Worlds Fair exhibit were all lost. This,
however, was not the greatest loss. Tesla possessed a phenomenal memory and
could easily rebuild, and many of his photos were copied.
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig05.jpg" alt="Early Wireless Circuits">
</CENTER>
<P>
At the time that Tesla's lab burned down, he was developing a wireless
transmitter for communications. By 1895, Tesla claimed to have completed this
system and was prepared to test the prototype [22]. There is little doubt
that Tesla's powerful oscillators could be used for this purpose with
success. In that same year, Marconi officially became the first man to send
signals without wires [23]. The apparatus that he used was of the most
primitive order (above). The highly advanced four circuit tuned system used
by Tesla was not patented for radio used until 1900 [24]. 
<P>
At the time of the fire, Tesla was at the height of his scientific fame. A
number of people contributed money to him, and he himself was by no means
poor. Four months after the fire, in July of 1895, he took up residence at 46
E. Houston Street on the top floor, and began to reconstruct his laboratory
[25]. He Spent the next year or so rebuilding the equipment he was using in
his first lab. 
<P>
The second lab was illuminated entirely by fluorescent lighting, some of
which was wirelessly powered. Tesla, who had a flair for the dramatic, would
often close the heavy shutters during the day and show visitors the eerie
moonlike glow produced by these lamps. 
<P>
From 1896 though 1897, Tesla carried on work in several lines of research,
including mechanical oscillators and solar power engines [26]. However, his
primary fascination was still with high frequency current. To investigate
wireless power further, Tesla wanted to study the effects of voltages beyond
the one million volts produced by his conical coil. He had not yet detected
any earth resonance effects. By building bigger and bigger coils, Tesla knew
that he could reach any desired potentials, but he felt that there should be
a better way that would not require bulky coils or cumbersome insulation. In
other words, he wanted to make a relatively small transformer that would be
able to deliver almost any voltage. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig06.jpg" alt="Second NY Lab">
</CENTER>
<P>
Tesla found the solution while experimenting with variously shaped quarter
wave coils. He found that when a flat spiral shaped secondary is used, there
is an absence of corona loss and shorting between turns [27]. Even when bare
wire was used, there was no difficulty in producing many millions of volts.
This type of coil can be seen in the photograph of the second laboratory
(above). The primary and secondary coils were both mounted on a wooden base
and could be pivoted to bring the coil into a horizontal position. 
<P>
The oscillator on his main spiral coil was powered by a 50,000-volt transform,
which charged a 0.04-microfarad condenser [28]. This was discharged though
the eight foot (244 cm) primary, which was a single turn of heavy stranded wire;
by means of a high speed mechanical break (replacing the spark gap used in
earlier coils). This rotary break closed the circuit 5000 times per second.
The inductance of the primary coil was 8 micro henries, and the total
inductance of the primary circuit was 10 mh. The frequency used on this coil
varied from 230 KHz to 250 KHz. 
<P>
The secondary coil was made up of one hundred turns of insulated #8 copper
wire. The turns began at the primary coil and were carefully spaced to reduce
destructive capacitance in the coil, which will reduce the voltage and cause
power loss. The outer rim of the secondary would be grounded or possibly
connected to the primary. The center of the coil was connected to a bar,
which stuck out and curved down slightly. A six-inch ball was sometimes fastened
to the end of the bar. The maximum voltage of this coil was two and one-half
to three million volts, which created discharges up to 16 feet in length. (The
conical coil had produced up to 6-foot arcs). 
<P>
A large variety of experiments were carried on with this device. One of
Tesla's favorite demonstrations, to show that high frequency current was not
harmful, was to stand on a platform connected to the oscillator and instruct
his assistants to raise the potential to nearly 3 million volts [29]. At that
voltage, he was covered with sparks and said that he felt as though he were
burning up. 
<P>
One of the most important discoveries that Tesla made was the effect that
very high voltage had on the air's insulating properties [30]. Normally, air
becomes a fair conductor at about 75 millibars, but Tesla found that with high
frequencies and very high voltage, air becomes conducting at much higher
pressure. Using the three million volt spiral coil, Tesla tested the
feasibility of using the air to conduct power. 
<P>
He connected a 50-foot to be containing air at a pressure of 120-150 millibars
to the central terminal of the coil [31]. The other end of the tube was
connected to the center of a similar coil that would act as a step-down
transformer. With this arrangement, electric power could be transmitted with
good efficiency. At three million volts, even air at normal pressure could
conduct some electricity. 
<P>
This led Tesla to believe that he had discovered a way to transmitting not
just signals, but usable amounts of power. By using the atmosphere for one
conductor and the ground for the other, power in quantities large enough for
industrial purposes would be made available to anyone. This would, at first,
have been used for illuminating isolated homes or other places where it was not
practical to supply electricity. Tesla proposed building towers from which
balloons would be flown. The current at a voltage of 20-50 million volts
would be cabled up to 30 or 35 thousand feet where the air is adequately
rarefied [32]. 
<P>
Tesla had not tested voltages nearly this high, so he suggested that it
may be possible to use a much lower altitude for the transmission. At 20
million volts, it would not require much amperage to yield a great amount of
wattage, but it should not be immediately assumed that this system would
really work. 
<P>
In the spring of 1897, Tesla began distance testing of his wireless
telegraphy system (not to be confused with the aerial power system) [33]. On
a boat in the Hudson river, he placed a receiver and was able to pick up
signals at a distance of 25 miles. This was not the greatest range of the
system, but it was as far as the boat could go. He announced the completion
of this invention in July of 1897 [34]. Tesla made no attempt to patent this
until several years later, after he had done extensive research on it. He did
patent his aerial power system in 1897 (No. 645,576 and 649,621. Not granted
until 1900) [35]. The range of 25 miles was a considerable improvement over
Marconi's equipment, which had a range of two to nine miles at that time
[36]. The oscillator was powerful enough to send signals to very great
distances, but unfortunately, Tesla was not using long vertical antennas at
that time. He was working on the principle that his signals were traveling
through the earth as electric waves. 
<P>
<CENTER>
<img src="Tesla_fig07.jpg" alt="Telautomaton">
</CENTER>
<P>
In September of 1898, Tesla demonstrated a remote controlled boat in
Madison Square Garden during the First Annual Electrical Exhibition [37].
This boat is shown above. It was controlled by means of a single tuned circuit
that caused it to change direction. It could be made to steer in different
directions and stop and start with signals transmitted from a small
oscillator near the edge of the huge tank the boat sailed in. Tesla called
this machine an Automaton, and he believed that it would one day be used to
fight wars. Tesla suggested that boats and flying machines could be filled
with explosives and then directed to their targets for detonation. It was
patented in November of 1898 (No. 613,809) [38]. 
<P>
At that time, Tesla exhibited a larger boat containing several tuned circuits
that could respond to signals sent at different frequencies. This boat
employed wire loops within its hull that had condensers in them to cause them
to resonate. There was no outside antenna. This vessel could stop, start,
turn and light lamps mounted on it. Tesla was advised not to attempt to
patent this type of system by his patent attorney. This may have happened
because Sir Oliver Lodge had patented a method of tuning wireless telegraph
circuits earlier that year [39].
