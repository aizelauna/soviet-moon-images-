&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's difficult to make out the shape of this burned out apartment through all the piled boxes, papers and newspapers.  One wall of boxes almost completely blocks your view of The Mother and her cot, and her followers.  The rest of the boxes make a low-lying rubble of wreckage which frames the shape of The Savior so well.  This is the man you've heard about - who will bring you to bless and Heaven.  He's back, and he's looking at you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCrucifixes lie about, and it's difficult not to notice the resemblance.

You wander to the left of The Savior, who watches you as you go, and you find a gap in the wall of boxes that leads to his Mom's place.
