&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHigh above the city, the only thing above this room is the stone steeple, hopelessly striving to reach above the haze hanging over Bellona.  The walls on each side of the room only come about two feet off the ground, leaving them open from there to the bottom of the steeple's crown, at least ten feet above you.  The wind that never ceases here is cold, and causes the heavy rope dangling from the gargantuan brass bell to sway a bit.  The tarnished, worn bell dominates the room, never moving but leaving little room to manoeuvre around it.

You cautiously take the rope in hand, and slide down to the room below.
