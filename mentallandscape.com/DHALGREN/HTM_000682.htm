&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe gravel road runs north, lined with galvanized trash cans that no one fills or empties anymore.  To the west is a chain-link fence.  At the northern end, the alley ends at a high brick wall covered with thick vines.  You can hear dance music coming from the other side of the wall.

[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000131.htm">Narrow Alley</A>.
You scramble over the fence.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see an old brick wall about seven feet tall.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_000431.htm">The Rave</A>.
You reach the top of the wall with your hands and manage to find some foot holds and thick vines. After hoisting yourself to the top of the wall, you drop down on the other side.
