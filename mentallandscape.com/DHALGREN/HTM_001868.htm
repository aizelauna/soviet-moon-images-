&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a grassy park, with people milling about here and there. Many fairgoers are huddled into a circle around a strange jester with a black and white outfit, covered with question marks. You listen for a while; this fellow is too funny! He juggles well, too.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A path leads back east across the crowded wooden bridge; you notice that darned slimy beggar blocking your path again.

You avoid the slimy beggar just as he's importuning another unfortunate passerby and find yourself back on the bridge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp He is garbed head to toe in black and white. He is currently juggling torches, which happen to be lit! He catches one by the flaming end, yelps and throws it, but does not seem to be hurt. What a trick! He looks pointedly at a lyre case holding some money.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the south, you can make out what appears to be a live role-playing game of some sort, with people dressed up in period costumes sneaking about the ruins of an old castle.

You brush through the crowds and find yourself in an open clearing right in front of a ruined castle.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the west, you can see the Rue de l'Imagination, which is crowded with lots of small stores and shops.

You brush through the crowds and emerge into the Rue de l'Imagination, which is lined with many shops and stores.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the north, you can see a lot of SCA fighting and demonstrations of other medieval skills. It looks rather interesting.

You brush through the crowds skillfully and find yourself standing near a wide grassy meadow being busily beaten flat by many feet.
