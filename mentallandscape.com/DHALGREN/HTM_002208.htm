&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is your run of the mill drag queen. Ipsol has been around the block. She is well built and stands about 5'9" tall. She has curly black hair that comes to her waist. Yes, it's really hers. She is a handsome woman... really. She is wearing a fitted patent leather body suit that is peppered with zinc studs. Her make up is impeccable. On her feet are stiletto-heeled, knee-high boots. She is wearing a pair of velvet ball gloves. In her hand she carries a whip: the symbol of her dominatrix trade. She looks like a good listener as well as a wise teacher.
