<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs you wander off the Plaza, you find yourself in a tangled maze of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalleyways where the stone seeps grey-green fluid, and the moans of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfevered lovers in rooms above mingles with the hissing pleas of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcrippled beggars. One alleyway beckons to you, and you find yourself
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspclimbing rotting wooden stairs and stumbling into a dark and open
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsparchway.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe smell of night sweat and the faint reek of burning dagga 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcome to you as you squint at the ominous clutter of this crowded
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspspace. Mysterious piles of papers and books surround you, threatening
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto collapse into your path at any moment, a threat given extra force
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspby the presence of pungent candles burning sporadically into the dark
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfrom atop the piled materials. As you thread your way through the maze
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof letters, you also catch sight of carved masks, perverse statuary,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa pile of rusted scimitars firmly embedded in the pitted wooden floor,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe mounted skeleton of a prehistoric wombat, a broken telescope, a
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe floor plan of the Library of Alexandria, a signed portrait of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTamerland, a map of the time zones on the planet Mars, and a host of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspless identifiable objects cluttering every nook and cranny of the room.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNear the back, you see a desk piled high with parchment pages, an
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspinkwell, and a computer terminal whose screen periodically flickers to
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplife only to crackle into silence moments later. Next to the desk is
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa small cot with a bedspread made from ten kente strips clumsily knitted
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptogether. At the foot of the cot, there are four ancient televisions
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspproviding an eerie digital light and propped precariously against the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoaken wall. On the wall on the other side of the desk, there is a map
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof Africa dotted with cryptic notes and markings.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001035.htm">Map of Africa</A> and <A HREF="HTM_001011.htm">Ibn_Khaldun</A> here.

<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the rapid scratching of a pen on parchment somewhere in the dark.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe computer monitor crackles violently.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA strong smell of dagga tickles your nostrils suddenly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou get the impression that someone is watching you.
