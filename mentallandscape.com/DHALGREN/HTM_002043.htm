&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                       Song of Bear
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspway, and twisted that way and then turned and looked right
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspat the bush where the bear was hidin'."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'I know you're in there,' the young woman laughed.  'I
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspknow you've been following me.  Watching me.  Scaring fish
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmy way so I could catch them.  You come out from that bush
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand let me see you.'"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "And the bear just about swallowed its tongue, but it stood
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspup, sunlight glitterin' on its black fur, and it walked toward
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe freshwater pool, just as scared as anybody is when the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspone you love takes notice of you for the first time."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'Come into the water,' the young woman invited, and the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbear walked into the water, and they swam together, and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthey splashed each other, and the girl fastened her fingers in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe bear's thick fur and the bear swam, pullin' the young
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwoman easily.  Then they lay in the sun to dry, and the bear
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstared at the young woman and wanted to touch her and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplove her."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'I love you,' the bear managed, even though its voice was
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcaught in its throat."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'Why did you hide?' the young woman asked."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'How could anybody as beautiful as you love a bear?' and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa tear trickled from the poor bear's eye."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "Well, the young woman took the bear's head in her lap,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand stroked its fur and kissed its nose, and said 'But you're
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeautiful.  Strong, and gentle, and beautiful, and I do love
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou.'"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "'I'm a female bear,' the bear said."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "The young woman sat for a long long time and then she
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplaughed and said 'If I can love a creatre that looks as dif-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspferent from me as you do, why should I care if you are a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmale bear or a female bear?  I love you, bear.  I wouldn't not
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplove you if you were skinny, or if you were fat, or if you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwere shorter, or if you were taller, because it's the love in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou that I love, and the beauty in you that I love.  Anyway,'
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe young woman laughed, 'meat and bones don't matter, it's
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhat's inside them, the love spirit.'"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "And she stood up and the bear stood up and the young
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwoman put on her dress, and took the bear's paw and walked
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
