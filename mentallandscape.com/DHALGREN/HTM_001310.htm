<H3> Le Cafe' Fetish (#1310)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000907.htm">melusina</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe drab plastic prefab walls are draped in black velvet. A series of bug-zappers suspended from the ceiling bathe the room in a sickly blue light, punctuated by the repetitive blinding flash of a concealed strobe.  Each stab of light provides an instant of harsh illumination.  The low-slung couch shoved against the far wall, the plain wooden chairs grouped about a table fashioned from a broken concrete slab, the small iron cage in the corner.  
<BR>
<BR>
You sink down into the prickly cushions of the couch.  It's so low that you are nearly crouching, your knees higher than your hips.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Perched upon clawed feet, the couch hovers low to the ground.  It is covered in a dark rough fabric, perhaps burlap.  Whatever it is, it's itchy.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Uncomfortably low, the jagged edges of the concrete tabletop look knee threatening.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001385.htm">Trix</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000323.htm">Jeremy</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000919.htm">Dying Moon Carnival</A>.
You grope your way along the east wall until you find the door.  Pushing it open, you escape back into the relative sanity of the carnival.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ north ] <A HREF="HTM_000923.htm">The House of Freaks</A>.
Looking closely at the gap in the velvet, you discover a doorway roughly cut into the north wall, covered on the other side by ripped canvas. You part the canvas and step through.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An unassuming little cage, about the size and shape of a phonebooth. Its door hangs open invitingly, and the shadows inside seem deeper than in the rest of the room, as if billowing upwards from a hidden source.

Taking a deep breath, you walk into the cage.  You realize that it has no floor, but is instead set over a hole in the ground.  Lowering one foot into the gap, you discover that a rough wooden staircase leads down into the darkness.  You carefully descend, gingerly trailing your fingers along the clammy walls for balance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_002016.htm">Behind the Fetish</A>.
Gingerly moving aside the fabric covering the western wall, you discover a hole in the shed's plastic shell.  You carefully step through the jagged gap, moving outside with some sense of relief.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ southwest ] <A HREF="HTM_002347.htm">The Whipping Post</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a metallic flash as the strobe light dances across a pair of handcuffs hanging from the wall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tall woman in a rubber teddy and stiletto heels brushes imperiously past you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA muffled leathery thump sounds suspiciously like a riding crop falling to the ground.
<BR>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTrix struts about the room, idly toying with the zipper pull on her jumpsuit.
