&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe landing overlooks the spacious entrance hall, a stairway descending to its floor.  The stained glass window on the south wall is at this height; it depicts a giant orange sun setting over a ruined city.  A hallway runs east and west here, and to the north is a padlocked door.
