<H3> Armand (#464)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000464.htm">Armand</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis man is a man who treads 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith careful footsteps, quiet,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspas if walking into each room
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspso as not to startle the sleeping.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis blood moves slow in his veins--
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnot sluggish, but with great heat and pressure,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa restrained wildness.  His eyes, 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthey're dark, but when you talk to him,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphis gaze burns into you,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand you can't help but watch his lips,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspimagine his warm breath on your skin,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspat your pulse.
