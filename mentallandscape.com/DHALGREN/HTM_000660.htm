&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a tower struck by lightning.  A crowned and an uncrowned man are thrown down from its heights with the ruins of the battlements.  It is the symbol of material forces that can crush great and small alike.  It is also the emblem of rivalries which only end in ruin for all concerned; of frustrated plans, of hopes that fade away, of abortive enterprises, ruined ambitions and catastrophic deaths.
