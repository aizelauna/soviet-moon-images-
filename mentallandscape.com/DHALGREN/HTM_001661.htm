&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a large patio covered with lounge chairs and boasting an olympic sized swimming pool and a large and very crowded hot tub. There's a small changing room and shower set up against the wall of the North Tower. The patio is enclosed by the North and South Towers, the glass wall of the atrium to the east, and a wrought iron fence to the west.
