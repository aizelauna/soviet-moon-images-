&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou stand in the middle of a decaying yellow-lined asphalt road.  The shoulders have disappeared, leaving only a jagged crumble of tar where the road drops off into underbrush.  Decayed rubber pylons and buckled safety barriers are visible four or five meters into the trees.  The road disappears abruptly into a steep dirt-banked gully to the east; to the west you see a large concrete expanse ringed by dead trees.  A grassy clearing lies to the north.
