&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[THE QUEST 7/2]
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [Da Avabhasa] Source of phenomena,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp mind, and the mechanics of attention
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The cognitive quality of actual post-death bardo
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp experience depends directly on the depth and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp penetration of Spiritual practice when alive.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [Kenneth Ring] the NDE may be an archetypal journey,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a shamanic initiation into the imaginal realm.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [As it has been suggested that millenialism is a near-death
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  experience on a cultural scale....]
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Carlos Castaneda, the renowned student of Yaqui Indian
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 'sorcery', says that the life review may be conducted
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp without any precipitating physical trauma. As Castaneda
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp recounts in _The_Art_of_Dreaming_ (1993), unacknowledged
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp personal content -- "filled to capacity with heavily
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp loaded emotions like memories, hopes, fears" -- can sap
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a practitioner's volition, energy and perceptual fluid-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ity. The only recourse is recapitulation, an exhausting
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sequential reconstruction of all events.
