&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA page torn out of an old book. The yellowing paper looks ready to crumble; but if you're careful you might be able to read it.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Every literature has its Babylon. Or rather, like that
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  other Babylon, not of the spirit, Babylon is one, and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  all nations have drunk of her wine. She, too, is the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  haven desired of 'everyone that saileth any whither'
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  by reason of her costliness, her merchandise of gold
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  and precious stones and pearls, of fine linen and purple 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  and silk and scarlet, thyine wood and ivory, cinnamon
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  and incense, wine and souls of men; and this Babylon
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  too will have fallen when the sound of the flute is no
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  more heard in her, and 'the light of a candle shall
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  shine no more at all.' All languages are spoken in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Babylon, yet with the same accent; here are gateways
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  of the Moors in Spain, Venetian waterways, streets of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Old Paris, and over all the undiscerning twilight. All
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  men meet in Babylon who go on pilgrimages, for all roads
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  end in Babylon, the Road of the San Grael, the Road of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  the Secret Rose.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          --Helen Waddell, LYRICS FROM THE CHINESE (1913)
