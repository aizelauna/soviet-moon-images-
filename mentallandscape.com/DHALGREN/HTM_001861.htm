&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA very shallow outlet of the duck pond flows under the bridge here. Fortunately, you are kept company in this slippery rockslide by a fairly pretty mermaid, who is cheating, and wearing a t-shirt.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There's a large crowd up on the bridge above you.

You climb the rocks back to the bridge.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ducks swim gracefully about the duck pond, which is crystal clear. Unfortunately it looks like the slope is slippery enough to make feeding the ducks a risky proposition.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The local mermaid-for-a-day is wearing a t-shirt and an artificial fish tail made out of sequins; the fish tail glitters brightly green at you. She smiles as she catches you ooking at her. Sorry to disappoint you, but this is a public fair!
