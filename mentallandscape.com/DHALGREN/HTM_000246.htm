&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou have entered the large mansion. This is a place of learning, of redefining reality, and of finding the self. Most are welcome here, but be warned, the rooms of this place are subject to change without any warning. You are currently in the foyer, the only room known to remain where it is supposed to be. To the east is the main hallway, and a grand staircase leads up to a locked door.
