&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA high ledge runs along the northern, eastern, and southern walls. This ledge supports the statues and, so it seems, provides a hanging place for the thick curtains. The ledge is quite wide; it provides more than enough room for the statues, but, peering through the gloom, you can't quite tell if anything else is up there.
