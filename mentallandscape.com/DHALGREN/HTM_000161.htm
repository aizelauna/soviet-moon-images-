&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTall brick buildings jab up into the bright haze and disappear.  Most look abandoned, rain entering broken windows, but to the east is a high-rise apartment complex that looks like it is still being attended to.   A sign above the door says LABRY APARTMENTS.  To the west is the tallest office building in the city, a beautiful art-deco structure of marble and stainless steel.  To the northwest is Bellona Auditorium, and to the northeast stands the O.o.f Theater.
