&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspConsider these accessible through a MOO:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  mosaic type interfaces; hypertext
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  scanned collections (incl. rare books and special collections)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  library catalogs
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  film and video footage
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  3D VR for designers, architects, engineers, mathematicians
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  any other computerized tool
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMOO with graphics and windowing
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  @show opens your screen as a window for someone else
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  have @mail features also
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptext and hypertext tools (wordprocessors, spread sheets, math 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  processors, etc. etc. etc.) for education and collaborative 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  work
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Please note this may mean an end to any notion of 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp'intellectual property'--revealed as a perfect contradiction 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin terms.)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAdd sound, graphics, motion and 3D to that.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasic platform a gui?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInstruction, literacy training and help available throughout...
