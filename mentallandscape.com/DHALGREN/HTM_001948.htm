&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis portion of the ledge runs along the northern wall; from here, you can see the hooks that hang the northern curtain, and also the statues that stand perched on this side of the ledge. The statues have been hacked and chipped at to remove the precious jewels which adorn them. Perhaps Harv's Bargain Basement isn't a straight business? The ledge meets the western wall here, leaving you able only to return to the east.

Hanging carefully onto the curtains, you half climb/half slide your way back down to the floor below. Those curtains feel strangely slippery.
