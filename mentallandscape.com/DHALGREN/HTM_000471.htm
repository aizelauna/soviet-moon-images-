&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSuperGuy has a run-in with an anti-polarity beam that makes him loose his super powers! SuperGuy and Pugatron have 12 pages of horrific battle! In the stunning cliff-hanger ending, SuperGuy seems like he is about to have his head cut off by a giant deli-slicer. A rare issue 220! This one must be worth a mint!
