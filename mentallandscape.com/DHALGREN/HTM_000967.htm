<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large red pill, with sinister markings.
<BR>
You gulp down a red pill with a glass of water. It has a metallic aftertaste. All of a sudden your heart starts pounding rapidly, your ears ring, your nerves tingle, and you are feeling very paranoid.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Your eyeballs begin to pop.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Things begin to spin before your eyes.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You hear a tingling in your ears.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You feel a compulsion to swallow and swallow, repeatedly.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Ineluctable modality of the visible.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Green dreams sleep furiously.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...I'm not a crook.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Whatever it is, I'm against it.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Strafing the surface in order to transmute the stabbing of bodies.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Everything chemical can be attained also by other means.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A screaming comes across the sky.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Which came first, the intestine or the tapeworm?
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A spinning asshole, spinning faster and ever faster, becomes a black hole.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Ah Pook Is Here.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...So it is Man whom we must now make up our minds to emasculate.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...I am devoured by fever.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The depth of the sky like an orgy of frozen light, lost.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...It is clear that the world is purely parodic.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The text is a fetish object, and this fetish desires me.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The medium is the massage.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Electric circuitry is an extension of the central nervous system.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Out of time and into space.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The television screen is the retina of the mind's eye.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The visions became flesh, uncontrollable flesh.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Love comes in spurts.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The world is all that is the case.
