<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA two dimensional world, broad black strokes on shiny white paper. Maggie and Hopey are bickering in the corner while Penny Century checks her lipstick and Izzy chases a fly.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Her tall, painfully angular frame is swathed in layers of tattered and shapeless black clothing. Long black dreadlocks hang over her pale, worn face, eyes obscured by black sunglasses. She wields a flyswatter with middling accuracy, cursing to herself.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Peering into a compact mirror, Penny dusts a bit of powder across her nose and gives her blonde hair a tweak. Glamourous as a 40s film star, she's late again.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Digging in the fridge for a beer and bitching at Maggie over her shoulder, she runs one hand through her spiky black hair and then reaches down to scratch at her leg through a hole in her black tights.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Maggie leans against the open fridge door, making faces at Hopey's back and watching to see if she finds any beer.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002140.htm">an empty pizza box</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ Tank ] <A HREF="HTM_000953.htm">a large glass tank</A>.
Fearing that you've pissed Hopey off, you quickly find your missing dimension and leave.
