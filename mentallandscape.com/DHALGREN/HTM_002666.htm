&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLong blue/black hair envelopes her as its length falls and sways. Her ice gray eyes hold honesty, which is sometimes cruelty, Her arched brows speak of arrogance. Her long patrician nose and high cheekbones echo past nobility, while her mouth, full and red, hold sensuality and passion. Her smile...mocking or gently welcoming...as her mood dictates, flashes your way. As you watch her, she runs her hands down her blood red silk gown, pulling it taut over her breasts to her abdomen and her flat stomach...slowly down to show her gently flaring hips and length of her legs. Her hair, disturbed...glitters and throws off blue sparks into the light. She is as she wishes...accept or deny her as you will.
