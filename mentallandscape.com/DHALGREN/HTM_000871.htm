&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         TSUNEMASA  -- Adapted from a Noh Play
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         as translated by Ernest Fenollosa
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  I am Sodzu Giokei, keeper of the temple of Ninnaji.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         Tajima no Kami Tsunemasa, of the house of Taira,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         was loved by the Emperor when he was a boy,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         but he was killed in ancient times
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         at the battle of the West Seas.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         And this is the Seizan guitar
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         that the Emperor gave him before that fighting.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         I offer the instrument to his spirit in place of libation;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         I perform services before him.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[the priest performs a service to the spirit of Tsunemasa.]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:   Although it is midnight,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          I see the form of a man,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         a faint form in the light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         Who are you? --- a spirit?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  I am the ghost of Tsunemasa.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         Your service has brought me.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  Is it? the ghost! of Tsunemasa?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         I can see nothing just a voice.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  Only the faint sound remains.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  But I did see it, a shape!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  It is there if you see it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  I can see.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  Are you sure? Do you see it?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  Oh, do I or don't I see you?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChangeful Tsunemasa, full of the unstillness of things,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp looked back upon the world. His voice was heard there,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a voice without form. No one could see him,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp but he looked out from his phantom,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a dream that gazed on our world.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  It is strange ... ... Tsunemasa!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         The figure was there and is gone
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         only a thin sound stays.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         A film of a dream maybe.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         It was a reward for this service.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  When I was young I went into the court.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         I had a look at life back then.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         I was favored, was given the Emperor's
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         guitar. The same guitar you have there.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         It is the lute called 'Seizan'.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         When I walked in the world it was mine.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is the guitar he had in this world,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp but now he will play
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the music of the blessed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  Bring out what instruments you possess,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         and follow his music.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  And I will lead you unseen.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The spirit plays.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  Midnight is come;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         we will play the 'midnight-play'.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  The clear sky is become overclouded;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         the rain walks with heavier feet.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  They shake the grass and the trees.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  It was not the rain's feet. Look yonder.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A moon hangs clear on the pine-bough.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The wind rustles, as if flurried with rain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is an hour of magic.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bass strings are something like rain;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the small strings speak, whispering.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The deep string is a wind voice of autumn;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the third and the fourth strings are like
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the crying stork in her cage, when she thinks
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of her young birds toward nightfall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Let the cocks leave off their crowing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Let no one announce the dawn.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  A flute's voice has moved
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         the clouds of Shushinrei.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         And the phoenix came out from the cloud;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         they descend with their playing. Pitiful
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         marvellous music! I have come down
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         to the world. I have resumed my old playing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         And I was happy, here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         All that is soon gone.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPRIEST:  Now I can see him again,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         the figure---I saw here;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         can it be ... Tsunemasa?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSPIRIT:  I make a sad figure.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp         Put down the lights if you see me.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The sorrow of the heart
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp is a quickly spreading fire.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The flames are turned to rain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp He slew by the sword, and was himself slain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The red wave of blood rose in fire,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and now he burns.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     He bade us put out the lights;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        he flew like a summer moth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp His brushing wings were a storm.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp His spirit is gone in the darkness.
