&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo connect two rooms with exits, you use @dig again.  Go into one of the rooms.  
Suppose you want to connect the hallway to the smoke-filled room (#101).  Then type:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @dig north,n|south,s to #101
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis will build two exits at once, one going to the room (via "north" or "n") and 
one returning from that room.  Don't neglect to DESCRIBE THE EXIT, so someone in 
the hall could "look north" and see some detail, such as a door with a name on it. 
 You should also SET EXIT MESSAGES if you want to describe motion or failure of motion:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @nogo west is "The passageway is too dark."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @leave west is "You venture into the passage with a lamp."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspType "@messages south" now, to see how one of the cave exits is messaged.
