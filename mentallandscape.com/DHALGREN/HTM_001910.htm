<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see two statues, carved out of a single piece of marble. One is a panda, waist 
height to a man, who looks at you with big panda eyes. The other is a human, male, 
sitting lazily on the ground. He has an enormous grin on his face as he scratches 
the panda behind the ears. The panda looks pleased. On the man's shoulder is a dragon, 
three-headed, two-tailed.
