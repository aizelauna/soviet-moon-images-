&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     "Bad news.  A metavirus," Juanita says.  "It's the atomic bomb of informational 
warfare--a virus that causes any system to infect itself with new viruses."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "And that's what made Da5id sick?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "Yes."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "Why didn't I get sick?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "Too far away.  Your eyes couldn't resolve the bitmap.  It has to be right up 
in your face."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "I'll think about that one," Hiro says.  "But I have another question.  Raven 
also distributes another drug--in Reality--called, among other things, Snow Crash. 
 What is it?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     "It's not a drug," Juanita says.  "They make it look like a drug and feel like 
a drug so that people will want to take it.  It's laced with cocaine and some other 
stuff."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     "If it's not a drug, what is it?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     "It's chemically processed blood serum taken from people who are infected with 
the metavirus," Juanita says.  "That is, it's just another way of spreading the infection."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "Who's spreading it?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    "L. Bob Rife's private church.  All of those people are infected."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Hiro puts his head in his hands.  He's not exactly thinking about this; he's 
letting it ricochet around in his skull, waiting for it to come to rest.  "Wait a 
minute, Juanita.  Make up your mind.  This Snow Crash thing--is it a virus, a drug, 
or a religion?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Juanita shrugs.  "What's the difference?"
