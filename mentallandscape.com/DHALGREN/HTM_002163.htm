Subj: Yet another list, woo woo.
<BR>

<BR>
It seems that conversation around here often turns to the cool things we've read/mean to read when we have the time, or to the horrid things that we've suffered through reading but firmly believe that no one else should have to experience.
<BR>

<BR>
So, in the interests of creating MORE mail for people to read, and in turning my elseReality procrastination into something productive SOMEWHERE, I've made this list.  *coolthingstoread, *cttr, or *books.  I put *books as the last alias because I wanted to indicate the flexibility of the list (heh.  Like the populace wouldn't just run with it anyway).  Anyway.  So, what are the cool things you've been reading lately?
<BR>

Heh.  No, I'm not a librarian, I just play one on the MOO.  Actually, I've been told that I look quite like a librarian when I wear my glasses, but.
<BR>

<BR>
Here's my pick of the week:  _Drawing Blood_, Poppy Z. Brite's new one.  The blurb on the back from _Fangoria_:  "Exotica...disaffected youth...a spicy gumbo of sub-cultural hipness simmered in a cauldron of modern horror fiction." 
<BR>

<BR>
It's a ghost story populated by a comicbook artist and a hacker on the run.  I liked this one better than _Lost Souls_ (even though LS is her vampire novel, woowoo), maybe because it isn't also populated by a series of women who exist only to die gruesomely.  Not that I've got anything against a good gruesome death, but LS sets my critical teeth on edge.  Sexy vampires, though.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh, and while I'm on the subject of Brite, she's got a new collection of vampire erotica out (she's the editor; none of the pieces are hers) called, um, ohdamn, my room seems to have eaten it.  It's got a red-eyed vampire with impossible cleavage on the cover, though.  You can't miss it.  Actually, DO miss it.  Although a few of the stories are pretty interesting, it's not worth the glossy-oversized-collection price.

Subj: Red Mars
<BR>

<BR>
I don't care much for sci-fi, but I'm reading an interesting book now called _Red Mars_ by Robinson.  Frederick Jameson compares it to _The Disposessed_ by LeGuin.  It's the first of a series about the colonization of Mars.  Technically very realistic, but what is really interesting about this book is the character development and the political intrigue.
<BR>

<BR>
The book is really about building a new world.  Starting with a group of idealistic scientists, who themselves are split over the issue of whether to terriform Mars or not, the author adds in the pressures of "newbie" colonists and the power struggles of countries and transnational corporations on Earth.

i haven't read _red mars_, but next semester i am taking a course based on the book.
<BR>
interestingly enough, the course is a MUD.  it's an anthropology course where you and your classmates settle `red mars', and conduct studies on the social development of your settlement.  the pre-existing mars that the class settles upon is based on _red mars_.  i am told the book will be recommended but not required reading for the course.
<BR>
nifty, eh?  _and_, it's a 300-level course, where the prof tells me i'm certain to do well.  actually, the prof of that course is a fairly well-known inhabitent of dhalgren, woo woo!

Is this one of those books in the same series as _Alien_Tongue_?  I forget what the name of the series is, but it's got introductory essays by scientists and has the general theme of "REAL SCIENCE" fiction, that is, scifi with the pretense of plausibility.  Is this it?  I picked up some book about Mars like this years ago, but it was called _Red_Planet_, I think.  Or, is that a Heinlein title?  I'm getting confused.  Pass the crack pipe, please.

Subj: Turner on pilgrimage
<BR>

<BR>
Marcus has been reading all kinds of fragments of things. One
<BR>
is an anthropology text:
<BR>

<BR>
  "In the evolution of man's [sic] symbolic 'cultural' action, we
<BR>
   must seek those processes which correspond to openendedness in
<BR>
   biological evolution. I think we have found them in those
<BR>
   liminal, or 'liminoid' (post-industrial revolution), forms of
<BR>
   symbolic action, those genres of free-time activity, in which
<BR>
   all previous standards and models are subjected to criticism,
<BR>
   and fresh new ways of describing and interpreting sociocultural
<BR>
   experience are formulated. The first of these forms are
<BR>
   expressed in philosophy and science, the second in art and
<BR>
   religion.
<BR>

<BR>
--Victor Turner, DRAMAS, FIELDS AND METAPHORS: SYMBOLIC ACTION
<BR>
IN HUMAN SOCIETY (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1974), p. 15
<BR>

<BR>
  "I tend to see pilgrimage as that form of institutionalized or
<BR>
   symbolic structure (or perhaps meta-structure) which succeeds
<BR>
   the major initiation rites of puberty in tribal societies as
<BR>
   the dominant historical form. It is the ordered anti-structure
<BR>
   of patrimonial feudal systems. It is infused with voluntariness
<BR>
   though by no means independent of structural obligatoriness.
<BR>
   Its limen is much longer than that of initiation rites ... and
<BR>
   it breeds new types of secular liminality and communitas. The
<BR>
   connection between pilgrimages, fairs or fiestas, and extensive
<BR>
   marketing systems will be discussed later....(Turner, p. 182.)
<BR>

<BR>
[comment--Sites of pilgrimage prove often to be shrines to the
<BR>
 Goddess, located in a web mapped across, in relation to, but
<BR>
 not congruent with the map of the hierarchies of political
<BR>
 and concentrated economic power. One wonders how activity on
<BR>
 the net may be likened to a pilgrimage; and what are its
<BR>
 centers and circumferences....]

Subj: Gamble's God-Idea
<BR>

<BR>
Another book off the wall from Marcus--
<BR>
_The_God-Idea_of_the_Ancients_, by Eliza Burt Gamble. (New York: 
<BR>
   G.P.Putnam's Sons, 1897.)
<BR>

<BR>
     'By this attempt to construct a masculine Deity, absurdities 
<BR>
   were presented to the human judgment and understanding which 
<BR>
   for ages could not be overcome, and by it contradictions were 
<BR>
   necessitated which could not be reconciled with human reason 
<BR>
   and with the ideas of Nature which had hitherto been held by 
<BR>
   mankind. It was not, therefore, until reason had been suspended 
<BR>
   in all matters pertaining to religion, and blind faith in the
<BR>
   machinations of priestcraft had been established, that a male 
<BR>
   God was set up as the sole Creator of the universe.
<BR>
     'When women, who had become the legitimate plunder not only 
<BR>
   of individuals but of bands of warriors whose avowed object was 
<BR>
   the capture of women for wives, had degenerated into mere tools 
<BR>
   or instruments for the gratification and pleasure of men, 
<BR>
   Perceptive Wisdom or Light, and Maternal Affection the 
<BR>
   Preserver of the race, gradually became eliminated from the 
<BR>
   god-idea of mankind. Passion became God. It was the Creator in 
<BR>
   the narrowest and most restricted sense.' (p. 103)
<BR>

<BR>
Normally Marcus doesn't go for God stuff much. But has a 
<BR>
  definite thing for fin-de-siecle moralizing....
<BR>

<BR>
Next he'll have to quote from Alice LePlongeon's deathless 
<BR>
  1902 epic, Queen_Moo's_Talisman.

<BR>

<BR>
OK, I've already failed several times in trying to describe this book. Lemme make one more effort.
<BR>
Jane Bowles is a better writer than Paul Bowles, though less known. Two Serious Ladies bears a certain relationship to The Sheltering Sky, except it is even _more_ scary than Paul's novel, while at the same time being hilariously funny (as Paul never is).
<BR>
My best metaphorical comparisons to other novels & writers: 2 Serious Ladies is like Jane Austen on LSD, or like Lewis Carroll if he had been a lesbian.
<BR>
Favorite quote: "Mrs Copperfield started to tremble after the girl had closed the door behind her. She trembled so violently that she shook the bed. She was suffering as much as she had ever suffered before, because she was going to do what she wanted to do. But it would not make her happy. She did not have the courage to stop from doing what she wanted to do. She knew that it would not make her happy, because only the dreams of crazy people come true. She thought that seh was only interested in duplicating a dream, but in doing so she necessarily became the complete victim of a nightmare."

Another one of my favorite neglected writers. British, upper-class, 1901-1968, lifelong junkie.
<BR>
Her earlier books are kinda boring, but the late ones (like _Ice_, _Julia and the Bazooka_, and _Mercury_) are really amazing.
<BR>
They are hallucinatory, obsessive, and hyperbolically masochistic. Characters wandering through delirious northern ice-filled landscapes. The cliche of female-as-vulnerable-victim pushed to so extreme a point that it becomes something else entirely...
<BR>
Heartrending, and yet somehow ferocious at the same time.

Author of only one novel: _Miss Macintosh, My Darling-, 1198 pages long and published in 1965.
<BR>
Kinda hallucinatory; gorgeous page-long sentences, shifting in and out of the consciousness of a whole gaggle of crazed, deluded characters.
<BR>
Continual kaleidoscopic delirium--swindlers, suicides, rich new england junkies, vigorous midwestern hyperrealists, heroic Lesbian mountain climbers, incestuous/necrophiliac Republicans, women obsessed with hysterical pregnancies and abortions, men obsessed with money, music, and metaphysical conundrums...

Subj: the snow queen/building carbuncle
<BR>

<BR>
this book is a cool thing to read, but this post is also in reference to a post i made on *g about combining the settings of other authour's books with the setting already existing here.
<BR>
the book is called "the snow queen", by joan d. vinge.  she has taken the faery tale of the same name by hans christian anderson and turned it into a fascinating space opera of sorts, set in a futuristic world where highly advanced technology and space travel are made available to all.
<BR>
basically, the book revolves around the snow queen, who rules in the city of carbuncle, on the planet of tiamat, and a pair of young lovers whose destiny she steps into the middle of.  the young woman must save her lover from the enchantment of the self-centered snow queen, and defeat her to keep her from potentially causing much greater harm.  of course, since it is a 500+ page book, there's a lot more to it, but that's the very basic storyline.
<BR>
what occured to me as possibly compatible with dhalgren was the city of carbuncle.  this city was built upon an island on a planet of mostly water, but quickly grew to be its own island, in and of itself.  in the story, carbuncle is the center of interaction between natives and offworld travelers, as well as the center of exchange of technology for other things.  however, the planet of tiamat is cut off from the rest of the planets by a "black gate" that closes every 100 years for 100 years, then opens again for another century.  now, the offworlders provide the technology to the natives, but keep them from developing it themselves by forbidding the study of working technology, and by disabling all technology on the planet just before the gate closes and nearly all the offworlders depart so as not to get stuck on tiamat for the rest of their lives.  this keeps the people of tiamat, who become dependant on the technology (including the snow queen), under the thumb and at the mercy of the offworlders, who benefit from exploiting the technology-addicted tiamatan people when the black gate finally opens up again and they can return.
<BR>
my point in relating all of this is that i personally would find it interesting to have a city here that is somewhere off the coast, surrounded by water, where the possibility for technology remains just out of reach, due to its deliberate and permanant disabling.  i can see such a situation leading to sort of the same environment and "feel" that i believe is a major - and important - part of bellona.  call it post-apocalyptic or whatever... i'm pretty sure you all know what i mean about the air that this setting has to it.  i believe that at least one of theconcerns with building new areas is the desire to keep the same "feel" to everything that bellona has, but i also think that this has the potential to be a complete change of scenery and chance for building/exploration while still keeping with the feel and air that bellona has about it.                                  
<BR>
anyhow, this was something that just jumped in my head this afternoon, and seemed to have some potential.  i'll agree that this would need to be fleshed out a bit more before building were to commence, but i'd like to know what you all think about it...is it a good idea, or does it suck smelly sweat socks?  what do you think?

I read this extra-cool, early 60's SF work a long time ago. It's way out of
<BR>
print, and I LOST (argh!) my paperback copy.
<BR>
On the subject of building, it strikes me as a quite Dhalgrenoid thing to possibly add to our fair postopolis.
<BR>
The novel is about a surreal underground mega-survival-shelter complex in a post-apocalyptic land. As the hero descends deeper into this bizarre environment (halls carpeted with living mutant white mice ... a whole level of pleasure-seekers in total denial ... ) he becomes aware of an underlying, Goddessy, witch-conspiracy, led by the mysterious Despoina.
<BR>
Is anyone else familiar with this much-neglected work?

<BR>

<BR>
Well, I know you've all been just -dying- to hear what I've been reading lately.  I just finished -Frisk- (novel) and -Wrong- (stories) by Dennis Cooper.  Very queer, very edgy, very graphic, very I-love-you-so-much-I'm-going-to-eat-you (this last very is probably why -Frisk- reminded me of Winterson's -Written on the Body-, although the two have little else in common).  I personally preferred his stories to the novel; seems to me that the sort of experimentation with narrative he's after works better with the intensity of a shorter piece.  I've heard of his poetry, but not read any.  Anyone have any title recs?
<BR>

<BR>
The thing that I'm reading right now is -The Alphabet Man- by Richard Grossman.  This is one that I just pulled off of the shelf because I liked the cover (red photo of a scary clown and a little kid), it was nice and thick, a flip-through revealed that there's visual play within the text (pages of nothing but AAAAAAAA, for example), and it's about a psychotic poet/serial-killer.  So, all in all, right up my alley.  The author, again, is a poet.  -TAM- is his first 'published novel' (heh).  Anyone heard of this guy?  He's really impressing me, so far.
<BR>

I like Dennis Cooper, even tho his stories sometimes are too psychotic for my taste.  If you read _Wrong_, check out "Introducing Horror Hospital", the story of a young punk rocker with blue hair.  :-)  I like his novel _Try_ better than _Frisk_.  _Frisk_ has been made into a movie, and there is quite a bit of controversy over it, because it portrays some very negative fringe elements in queer culture.

Rebis wrote (wrt Cooper):  'each time his prose seduces men.'

Is this a typo for 'me', or is this an actual statement about the way that Cooper's prose works?  Because if it is, I'm wondering what sort of gender-specific seduction you're talking about, Rebis.  I mean, I was pretty seduced, and I'm not a man.

<BR>
In a new book called 'Flame Wars' edited by Mark Dery (Duke University Press) there is an interesting interview of Samuel R. Delany (by the editor) touching on race and politics in his work, science fiction at large, and the cyberpunk genre in particular. Delany, as usual, speaks trenchantly, especially in handling silly questions. 
<BR>
The book also reprints the good Dr.Dibbell's Village Voice article on LambdaMOO, and has a number of other essays on cyberculture which I didn't scan. (Maybe on my next extended trip to the local bookstore...)

Subj: VURT
<BR>

<BR>
I just finished reading VURT, by Jeff Noon, and I'm on a high. I've liked this more than any new science fiction novel I've read in I don't know how long; Noon is the first new author I've fallen in love with, since I fell for Kathe Koja last summer.
<BR>
I can't find any handy comparisons for VURT. The drugs/different levels of 'reality' stuff is reminiscent of Philip K Dick; the cyborgization of humans with robots, dogs, etc, is reminiscent of cyberpunk; but the overall tone and effect of VURT are way different from either. 
<BR>
The book is ironic and lyrical; which distinguishes it both from the grunge of Gibson & from the paranoia of Dick. The plot concerns (among other things) incest, beastiality, and addiction, but these are treated entirely matter-of-factly. The book is definitely pro-fun, even pro-ilegal-fun, and it takes for granted that of course we all hate the cops, but it isn't concerned with shock or transgression or anything like that. 
<BR>
More with the poetry of desire and loss.
<BR>
I'm not doing a very good job here of conveying its special weirdness and beauty, let's see...
<BR>
The RL of the novel is a future Manchester, UK, with its slums and its permanently unemployable youth underclass. The VR of the novel is VURT itself, a drug, an entertainment, a commodity, the fount of VURT-ual reality.
<BR>
VURT itself is a drug in the form of a feather, which may be blue, black, pink, white, or green--you stick it in your mouth, push it all the way back, and suck on it. VURT is sort of a living dream, it seems real to you but it's somebody else's dream--it is part Hollywood movie, part video game, part acid trip, part alternate world, part addiction, part commodity fetish. Or all of those at once. The VURT-world is separate from the real world, but the two continually cross over into one another--you have venemous dreamsnakes in cahoots with the cops, and bizarre alien beings whose regenerating flesh is the source of hallucinations. You have bodies transformed into psychedelic fractal rainbows, you have dogmen enamored of the smell of their own shit, you have an otherworldly bureaucracy that reads like a mixture between Monty Python and Kafka. 
<BR>
No, I can't describe this book. Better to end with one of my favorite quotes from it: "You have come for knowledge. There will be pleasure. Because knowledge is sexy. There will also be pain. Because knowledge is torture."
<BR>
Sorry for the length of this--couldn't help it--got carried away.

<BR>
Horror pick of the week:  -Grave Markings-, by Michael Arnzen.  I got it this afternoon and just finished it; I've got that uncomfortable edge that good horror leaves.  And this is good and ghoulish:  a crazy tattoo artist/serial killer runs amok, inflicting art.  Lots of good stuff about tats, also.  Mike's a friend of mine; this is his first novel and I think that his visions of horror are some of the coolest I've come across recently.  Check it out.
<BR>

<BR>
Also:  -Splatterpunks II:  Over the Edge-.  For those of you who like gross-out.  It's edited by Paul Sammon, and has lots of names (Barker, Brite, Koja, Collins &c).  My favorite is "Twenty-Two and Absolutely Free," by John Piwarski.  A good delirious story about what things might be like if serial killers get in on the capitalist specialization of labor.

<BR>

<BR>
The Shipping News (as advertised on this group earlier) by E. Annie Proulx, or anything else by her, because she has a wonderful tone and doesn't let stories about growing up become sloppy or sentimental.
<BR>
Crash by J.J. Ballard because it's really eerie and disturbing; a mix of sex and medicine and violence, like MTV on fast-forward.  Ballard says in the beginning, basically, that if all literature were erased from knowledge, what people would write is science fiction, as a predictive reflection of our lives.
<BR>
American Steel by Richard Preston.  He also wrote the Hot Zone.  As a biochemist, I was very disappointed in HZ.  American Steel is fascinating.  To be able to write a long book about a guy building a foundry is cool.  To be able to write a compelling book about it is amazing.  Even though I disagree with some of his points, I liked it.
<BR>
The Bean Trees by Barbara Kingsolver.  This just rocks.
<BR>
Yellow Raft In Blue Water by Michael Dorris.  Ditto above.
<BR>
Geek Love by someone I can't remember.  This is one of the WEIRDEST little books I've ever read, about a family of mutant circus performers, one of whom becomes a Hitleresque religous fanatic.  It's really disturbing and very hard to put down.
<BR>
Oh, by the way, in this book a geek is a circus performer who rips the heads off chickens with his/her teeth.  This gives you a bit more feeling for the tone.
<BR>
The Tale of Genji tr. by Arthur Waley.  This book is the soul of Japan.
<BR>
Winter's Tale by Mark Helpern.  Like a very mild acid trip through a fantastically literate sketch of New York City.  Dense, intricate, and wonderfully written.
<BR>
Blind Date by Jerzy Kosinsky, because I think any book that I can't keep reading, from revulsion, and can't put down, from fascination, is well-written.
<BR>
And, finally, Hothead Paisan the Homocidal Lesbian Terrorist by Diane DiMassa, because Chicken Rules!

*  _Farewell,_My_Lovely_ by Raymond Chandler.  He rocks, that Chandler does.  It makes me feel good to know that he didn't start writing until he was in his 40s.  I've got 20 years to slack off before I start my illustrious writing career.

*  _Big_Sur_ by Jack Kerouac.  I don't care what the rest of you think, but, in my eyes, there hasn't been a decent movement in American literature since the beats.  Sure, there have been some in "lesser genres," such as cyberpunk, but none that have really grabbed hold of a lot of people like Jack and Bill and Allen and blah blah blah did.  So, since it's been years since I've read any of this stuff, I'm going back and reading the ones I never actually read, such as _Big_Sur_, one of his latter novels.  I'd rather be thin than famous, but I'm fat!  Paste that in yr broadway show.
<BR>

<BR>
*  _Of_Human_Bondage_, W. Somerset Maugham.  I have no idea why I bought this, other than I sense that I should read it.
<BR>

<BR>
*  _Requiem_ by Michael Jan Friedman and some other guy.  A Star Trek novel.  Picard, on the eve of a big summit with THE GORN (the hissing lizard man from that great TOS episode where Kirk and the Gorn fight among the rocks) gets sent back into time.  This is fun trash to read.  God, I love it.
<BR>

<BR>
*  _The_Abolition_of_Work_, by Bob Black.  Fairly inane crap, but nifty sentiment.  Makes very little sense, would never work, but you've got to admire the guy for trying.
<BR>

<BR>
*  _Where_I'm_Calling_From_, by Raymond Carver.  Most of you probably despise Carver, but, hey, I despise a lot of what you read as well.  His stuff is curt, to the point, genuinely touching and most often insightful.  Too bad he's dead.
<BR>

<BR>
*  _The_Young_Punks_ by Leo Marguiles.  A mid-50s collection of short stories about kids named 'Biff' and 'Rod' who kidnap couples, beat the man senseless and gang-rape the woman.  Meant as cautionary tales, but works as comedy.  "Her only weapon: a beer-can opener!"
<BR>

<BR>
*  The output of the random-haiku generator.  "nuclear test site // next best thing to being there // let's get dangerous"

Subj: These should be classics and I don't know why they're not.
<BR>

<BR>
Katherine Anne Porter: short stories.  Really cool stuff about what things were like for a woman, alone, working in 1915, and some of the strange social stuff that went on then.  Also deals with the influenza epidemic that swept the world, but no one ever really talks about.
<BR>
Zora Neale Hurston: Their Eyes Were Watching God.  Another good quest-for-being story, nifty, fun, stirring, and so forth.  Hurston should be a household word, and only Alice Walker is really cheering for her right now.
<BR>
James Thurber: Thurber's Dogs.  This was one of the very first things I remember reading.  Thurber is great.
<BR>
Nathanial West: Day of the Locust.  A GREAT Armegeddon story, circa 1950.  Twisted view of California and the United States.
<BR>
S.J.Perelman: Chicken Inspector #23.  A very very sarcastic guy.  Like Thurber but really bitter.  He wrote most of the stuff for the Marx Brothers, and they had to turn most of it down for being too nasty.
<BR>
Oh, and for much more modern stuff, just read John McPhee's "The persistence of the bark canoe."  Really excellent if you like rafting/outdoors stuff.  McPhee just totally rocks.  Everything he's ever written has fascinated me, and this was no exception.
<BR>

Subj: City of Bits
<BR>

<BR>
William J. Mitchell's _City of Bits_ is supposed to be available in the bookstores any time now. One of the best discussions of cyberspace, etc.
<BR>
The book has a pretty cool Website as well, with (I think) the complete text, among other things: http://www-mitpress.mit.edu/City_of_Bits/index.html
