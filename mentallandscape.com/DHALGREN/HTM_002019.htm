&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis black hair ragged and his beard somewhat unkempt, Corwin looks at you with his jaded and cynical green eyes.  A weary smile plays at his lips as he looks out over this Shadow.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis green eyes flashing, Visitor stares out at you from beneath ragged black bangs. 
 His beard is unkempt, but does not hide the world-weary smile that plays about his 
lips.  His hair reaches to the collar of his well-worn biker's jacket, which covers 
a tight, silvery-grey t-shirt bearing the word 'ShadowMaster'.  His faded black jeans 
are torn in places, exposing tanned and muscular legs.  Very old combat boots cover 
his feet, and a pair of black leather gloves complete the ensemble.
