&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is the central western portion of Fox Terrace.  To the north, through the trees, is the public park known as the Feline Forest.  Across the street, to the south, is the driveway leading to the Open Anime Collective.  Fox Terrace extends to the east and west, various smaller houses visible eastward, while a corner of the park can be seen in the west.
