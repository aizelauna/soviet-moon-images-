<H3>brown goat (#1047): neglected</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA bedraggled brown nanny goat which looks like it would really appreciate some attention.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">feed</A> ] coaxes the brown goat over with some scraps, which it accepts eagerly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">milk</A> ] milks the brown goat, to its apparent relief.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047.htm">pet</A> ] pets the brown goat, which starts to look a little more hopeful.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State3.htm">ignore</A> ] ignores the brown goat some more. The brown goat seems to get irritated with her continued neglect.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State3.htm">kick</A> ] kicks the poor brown goat! It works up a nice dark mood, and scowls at her as only a goat can do.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State4.htm">woo</A> ] is wooing the goat (what a perv). The goat bats its long eyelashes at her.
