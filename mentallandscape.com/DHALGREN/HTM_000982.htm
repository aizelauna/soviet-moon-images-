&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis snow-covered mountain is the highest you see as you look around.  You are standing on the frozen fields of what seems to be an abandoned farmstead, and you see no signs of life anywhere along the ridge.  From out of nowhere an orange and white cat has appeared at your feet, beckoning you to follow.  As you walk behind his pawprints in the snow you begin to see the outlines of a red sandstone farmhouse through the trees.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour heart begins to pound as you behold the sight and smell of smoke curling up from the chimney-- it is occupied!  You notice that the cat is wearing a holographic collar, and as you bend to examine it you find that his name is Crusader Rabbit and you see an image of his owner, a woman with short brown hair and hazel eyes.  Crusader pushes the door open, and you both walk into a large and comfortable living room.  The only sounds you hear are the cracklings of the fire and an occasioanl meow; the surrounding hills are mute.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJo, the owner of the farmhouse, has recently returned to assess the damage and has discovered that her cache of merlot is still intact.  Sit, have a glass of hot spiced wine, and enjoy a brief respite from the devastation that surrounds us.
