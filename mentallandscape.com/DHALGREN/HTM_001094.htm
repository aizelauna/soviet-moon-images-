<H3> Narrow Hallway (#1094)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_001030.htm">Generic Stone Building Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000100.htm">Dred</A>)

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBarely illuminated, this section of hallway is quiet and brings a slow feeling of dread through your heart. The carpeting is full now and completely masks your movements. The stone walls are cold, but dry.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A simple wooden door set in the stone wall. Peaked at the top, it has a single brass door handle in the usual place.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001098.htm">Bedroom</A>.
You grasp the handle and try to turn it, expecting it to be locked. But it rotates with a soft click and the door opens soundlessly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A light up the hallway shows a stairway leading down.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001090.htm">Landing</A>.
With some relief, you go up the hallway to the head of the stairs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hallway extends further south.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001101.htm">Narrow Hallway</A>.
You continue down the hallway despite a growing sense of dread.
