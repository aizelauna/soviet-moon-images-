&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe streetsign on the corner lamppost says "Broadway".  Across the rain-drenched street to the west you see a loading porch.  From their tracks under the awning, four- and six-foot butcher hooks swing gently -- though there is no wind.  A fire escape runs up beside the porch.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the east is the Bellona Bus Depot.

You walk north several blocks, keeping an eye out doorways to duck into.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Acrose the street, a fire escape runs up the side of a building.
[ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000089.htm">Roof Top</A>.
You grab the bottom rung of the fire escape and climb up three stories to the roof.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Above several revolving doors a sign read "Bellona Bus Depot".

The revolving doors are stuck, but since the glass is missing anyway, you just step through.
