&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis huge and complicated room is filled with humming machinery, coolant pipes, and lots of electronic equipment. Thick cables lead through the ceiling to the roof antennae and dishes. A single large stepdisc intimidates you from the center of the room, leading to space-time continua unreachable by conventional transport: to other universes and other times. A panel with a keypad and screen is mounted on the wall.
