&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dim white light from an unknown source allows you to see a few details in this place. Though you can't see the walls, you have an intense feeling of claustrophobia here. Boxes and crates, trunks and antique wardrobes are stacked in piles and line the one wall, the north one, that you can see. Dusty sheets cover other unknown and unrecognizable shapes resting here in indefinite storage. The air is still here, which is strange because of the draft you felt below.

You see <A HREF="HTM_000666.htm">Grim Reaper</A> here.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A wooden trap door, old yet still very solid. There are cracks in it, and an iron slide allows one to lock it from up here.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_001174.htm">Base of Ladder</A>.
You pull open the trap door and climb down the ladder quickly.
