&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt last, fresh sweat-smelling air!  80 million years before Bellona, you stand on a heavily built platform of redwood, about fifty feet above ground.  Stands of redwood, cyclades, ginkgo and monkey-puzzle trees dot the landscape.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the distance, you see a pack of hunting Deinonychus, 160-pound bipeds with sickle blades on their feet.  They walk in an almost bird-like manner.  You ponder the fact that preditory dinosaurs evolved for almost twice as long as any mammalian hunter.  One suspects they would make quick work of a tiger or lion, perhaps disemboweling it in a flying 70 mile-an-hour leap.  Carved in the redwood railing is the word, "next".
