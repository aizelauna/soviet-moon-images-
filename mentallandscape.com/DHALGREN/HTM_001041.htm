<H3> ramshackle hut (#1041)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_002061.htm">Generic Room with Surfaces</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001021.htm">Boudicea</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are inside a small hut built mostly of rocks, with the roof composed of whatever the maker could find, mostly corrugated zinc and plant matter.  The floor is dirt, and there is a fire pit in the center.  The pile of goat skins in the corner is probably intended as a bed.  A flap covers the door to the outside.
<BR>
<BR>
You settle relatively comfortably into the pile of goat skins.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A dubious-looking heap of goat skins, probably warm, if itchy.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A fire pit built for the practicalities of warmth and cooking.  There are scorched bones in the fire that you hope once belonged to a goat.
<BR>

You see <A HREF="HTM_001047.htm">brown goat</A> and <A HREF="HTM_001021.htm">Boudicea</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can't see out the door because there's a goatskin hanging in the way.
