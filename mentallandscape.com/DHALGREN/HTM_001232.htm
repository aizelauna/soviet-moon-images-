After a moment, something begins to happen...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTao Te Ching, translated as The Way of Virtue or the pure "essence of what is right."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe way of the sage is to act but not to compete.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe more e gives to others, the more e has for eir own.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Requite injury with kindness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeek not happiness too greedily, and be not fearful of unhappiness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspManifest plainness, embrace simplicity, reduce selfishness, have few desires.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspE who knows how to be content with what e has got can never be despoiled, e who knows when to stop can never be in peril.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspE who exalts eirself does not rise high.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspActivity conquers cold, but stillness conquers heat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn managing human affairs, there is no better rule than self restraint.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFavour and disgrace cause one dismay; what we value and what we fear are within our self.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGive evil nothing to oppose and it will disappear by itself.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKindness in words creates confidence.                                    Kindness in thinking creates profoundness.                                    Kindness in giving creates love.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTao is real, is faithful, yet does nothing and has no form.  Can be handed down, yet cannot be passed from hand to hand,                     can be got but cannot be seen.                                                  is its own trunk, its own root.
