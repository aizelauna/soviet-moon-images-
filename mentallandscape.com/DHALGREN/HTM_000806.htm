&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou notice his eyes; cobalt in color, they draw you in. Judging by the scruff under his chin, he hasn't shaved in a few days. His dirty blond hair, except for a few migrant strands, is pulled back into a short pony tail. The gold hoop earring in his left ear glints slightly in the light. On his frame rest loose fitting clothes, all solid prints in dark colors, and his feet rest in a pair of sandals.
