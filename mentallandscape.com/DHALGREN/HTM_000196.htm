<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a tin can clattering on the pavement somewhere.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a display window shattered in the distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a dog barking in the distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou think you hear a car engine, although you have seen no traffic so far.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear voices and breaking glass in the distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA muffled explosion comes from somewhere far off in the city.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear someone yell from a rooftop nearby.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear several people running down the street.  You look up, but see no one.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA glass bottle smashes on the street near by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a garbage can knocked over somewhere near by.
