&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA wiry, filthy geek the apolcalypse took by suprise. There is a dull red glow from the now vacant sockets where once stereoscopic interfaces replaced blue eyes. his entire body is a network of dysfunctional and home made hard-wiring. This is the guilty cyborg, caught playing with himself in cold (cyber)spaces. His burnt fingers nervously caress the rips on his dirty leather trousers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe wears a pair of metal framed sunglasses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe wears a torn donnelly, It smells putrid under the crescent moon,.
