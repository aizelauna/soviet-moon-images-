(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000834.htm">Generic Litter</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000907.htm">melusina</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTattered and scorched, burned completely away in places, but still
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprecognizable as a paper plate. Someone with very tidy handwriting has
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwritten a paragraph on it in lavender ink.  All of the 'i's are dotted with flowers.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   When they arrived home, they could smell this awful sickening sweet
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsmell.  The mother rushed into the kitchen.  There she found the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptable set for two with her best china and crystal.  The lights were
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspout and there were lit candles on the table.  In the oven was their
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbaby.  The girl had roasted the baby!  She said, "Look, I fixed a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspspecial dinner for you."
