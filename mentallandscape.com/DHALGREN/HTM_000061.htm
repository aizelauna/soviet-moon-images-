(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000032.htm">Generic Help Database</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000038.htm">Hacker</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe object $help is the main help database.  For every help topic there is a corresponding property on $help, interpreted as follows:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp$help.(topic) = string           - one-line help text.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp$help.(topic) = {"*verb*",@args} - call this:verb(args,{}) to get text
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp$help.(topic) = any other list   - multi-line help text
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is also a "" property which applies in the case of `help' typed without any arguments.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSee the description of $generic_help for more detail.
