&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA paperback book, slightly dog-eared but the reader has been careful not to break the binding. You can see the author is named Richard Farina (wasn't he a folk singer?) and it appears to be a book about the early 60s.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo Athene then. Young Gnossos Pappadopoulis, furry pooh bear, keeper of the flame, 
voyaged back from the asphalt seas to the great wasted land: oh highways US 40 and 
unyielding 66, I am home to the glacier-gnawed gorges, the fingers of lakes, the 
golden girls of Westchester and Shaker Heights. See me loud with lies, big boots 
stomping, mind awash with schemes....Oh welcome, for home is the madman, home from 
his dreams and the satyr home to make hay.
