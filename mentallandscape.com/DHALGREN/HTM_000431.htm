&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Rave continues through the day.  Amid gasoline generators and loud speakers, a DJ weaves a tapestry of mind-bending music.  Dancers seek a shared state of consciousness, entranced in the timeless, neverending rhythms of techno and ambient house.  Some are chilling out, talking with friends, meditating on the music, sipping drinks laced with choline, vitamin B and ginko biloba.  From the field, paths head to the north and the northeast.
