<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are 4 types of objects: things, players, exits, and rooms. The first letter 
following an object's ID number indicates the type: P(layer), E(xit), R(oom). otherwise, 
thing. Things are inanimate objects that can be carried. Players are animate objects 
that can move and carry. Exits are the means by which objects move. Rooms are locations 
that contain objects and linked exits (in tinyMUCK, so can things and players).
