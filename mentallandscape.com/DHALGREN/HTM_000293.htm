<H3> Kidd (#293)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000293.htm">Kidd</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTall and thin, with longish black hair and strong cheekbones, and a niobium earring in his left ear.  He is wearing an open leather vest, letting you see a slightly-hairy chest, and glimpse the flash of a steel ring through his right nipple.  The nails on his long slender fingers are slightly bitten, and his bare foot seems a bit dirty.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe has a brass chain of mirrors, lenses and prisms wrapped around his neck and waist.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEncasing his right hand is a weapon made of several knives, resembling a beautiful 
flower.
<BR>
<BR>
Kidd is carrying <A HREF="HTM_000294.htm">Lights</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000586.htm">Brass Orchid</A>.
