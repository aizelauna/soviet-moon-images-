&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can see here a blind man carrying a full begger's wallet about to collide with a broken obelisk, on which a crocodile is waiting with open jaws.  This blind man is the symbol of he who makes himself a slave of material things.  His wallet is packed with his errors and his faults.  The broken obelisk represents the ruin of his works; the crocodile is the emblem of fate and the inevitable Expiation.
