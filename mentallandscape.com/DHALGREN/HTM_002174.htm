<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large board room of the XYZ club, in one of the cities down south.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a large conference table, upon which you see a man's belt, 1-1/2" wide
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand about 36" long.  It is black.  The chairs have all been moved to one side 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof this table, and, in the center of the room, a large sawhorse has been placed
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspon a small platform, to raise it slightly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe platform can accommodate a few men, beside the sawhorse.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeveral folding chairs are against the wall, and the room is large enough to
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphold quite a few people.
<BR>
