&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see an old room that has partly been repainted, but is not finished. Some new wirering hangs out from several places, and it has a fresh smell of sawdust. A couple of old workmen are running around. Trying to finish it in time.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNext to one of the walls you see a small hatch in the floor.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An old well used bamboo curtain hang here. Obscuring the view to the other room.
