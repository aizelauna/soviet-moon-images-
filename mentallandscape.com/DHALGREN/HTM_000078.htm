&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a handsome, pale boy from Seattle.  He gives you a quick smile when he sees you looking at him.  His hair is blond and parted in the middle, just long enough to dangle in his eyes.  A silver ring glitters in each ear, and a somewhat scraggly wisp of beard adorns his chin.  He's wearing a tank-top and a vest; his body is very slender and sharply defined, and you glimpse the corner of a tattoo on his right shoulder blade.  His jeans are faded and ripped at the knees, encircled by a wide black leather belt with holes all along it.  A chrome chain hangs from one belt loop to a wallet in his back pocket.  His fingers have some burns from operating an espresso machine, and from the way he keeps moving around, you can tell he drinks too many lattes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe has a brass chain of mirrors, lenses and prisms wrapped around his neck and waist.
