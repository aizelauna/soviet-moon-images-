<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a player who should type '@describe me as ...'.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Strange name, eh? Wholeflafferis a silly fellow. He hovers between 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeing philosphical and cynical. Most of the time, he is the former.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  He stands 6' tall (when he is standing). His features are not that
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstriking except that he has a 5" goatee and long hair that cascades over
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphis shoulders. He is never very far from his ever present combat boots
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspor an argument.
