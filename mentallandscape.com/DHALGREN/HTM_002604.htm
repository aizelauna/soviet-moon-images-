&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis may have once been the tomb of some rich and dignified citizen but now it is covered in graffitti and ankle-deep in trash. Obscene slogans plaster the walls, and the coffins lie strewn on the floor, where the bones of their previous occupants mingle with the garbage. Loud muffled punk rock plays from somewhere beneath the stone floor. Down a short flight of steps lies a small crypt. The smell of rot, cigarettes and alcohol is almost overpowering. THrough the cracks in the walls the rain patters on the rubbish and the sunlight streams in..
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Two ornate coffins, now lying empty on the floor. They look as if they were smashed apart by sledgehammers, or pickaxes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a collection of animal corpese, pornographic magazines, peices of rotting food, empty bottles, cigarette stubs, used contraceptives, badly copied version of Ginsberg and Kerouac, burnt books, swastika badges, spent candles and other unrecognisable matter.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ d ] <A HREF="HTM_002605.htm">A small Crypt</A>.
You take a breath and descend the stairs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ out ] <A HREF="HTM_002663.htm">Graveyard</A>.
You shudder as you leave the Mausoleum
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sudden wind disturbs the litter at your feet. Long dead film stars gaze with forlorn eyes from magazine covers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA shadow flits across the edge of your vision.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe sound of a child crying rises from the crypt.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou feel someone standing close behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA snake crawls inbetween copies of TIME magazine and the charred remains of Howl.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA strange odour of sex and decay fills your nostrils.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the sound of distant voices shouting in foriegn tongues.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA low mist seeps across the floor, disappearing into the crypt.
