<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBuilding and some other actions cost money. How to get money: 1) find pennies. 2) 
sacrifice (drop) things in the temple. 3) get killed. 4) be given money. 5) rob someone. 
Once you reach 10000 pennies, it becomes difficult to acquire more. See COSTS and 
SACRIFICING.
