After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Generic Costume is the costume with a difference.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you are a descendant of the Thespian (#1223), you can wear costumes. They change your description.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGeneric Costumes, however, are also scripted objects...you can write your performances directly on them (use @notedit <yourcostume>.script).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCostumes are fun to make, play with, and share with your friends.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSee help #1226 for more information...

HELP MANUAL:
<BR>
<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCostumes, descendants of #1226, are scriptable objects in which you may dress yourself 
in order to appear differently. In order to wear them you must be a Thespian (a descendent 
of #1223).
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the creator of a costume, you have two properties to set:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.role_msg (use @role costume is "<name>") -- the name of the role, which will appended 
to the Thespian's name or substitute for it under certain conditions.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.role_desc_msg (use @role_desc costume is "<description>" or @notedit costume.role_desc_msg) 
-- the description of the costumed Thespian, to be substituted for eir usual one. 
This description will accept the usual name and pronoun substitutions (Visitor, he 
etc.; see help pronouns).
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe costume also has a script which you may use to perform works of drama or pathos 
or spam your friends. To write it use @notedit costume.script. (You should at least 
save yourself @quota and delete the advertising copy currently scripted.)
