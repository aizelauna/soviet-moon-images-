<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBiker Bob is a big man.  Not fat, but built with the firm muscle of someone you wouldn't want to come up against in a fight.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBob's well-toned body is crowned by a shiny, bald dome.  His eyes remain hidden by sunglasses with nearly black lenses, and his face is tanned and somewhat unshaven.Both of his ears are pierced several times with dangling crosses, feathers, eagles, and silver hoops.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe seems to favour black clothing, with very few exceptions.  Under his black leather coat, you can see orange print reading "Harley Davidson" on his black t-shirt.  His black jeans are full of holes, and his black boots look heavy enough to crush a coconut.  Various heavy chains dangle from Bob's jacket and pockets, and solid-looking necklaces and rings adorn his neck and fingers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNot surprisingly, Bob is also well-adorned with many tattoos.  On his arms, you can see a heart inscribed with "Mom", several nude women, and an Indian chief, and other tattoos disapear up under the sleeves of his jacket.  He also seems to bear a sizeable amount of scars, and you notice  the large hunting knife strapped onto his black leather belt.
<BR>
<BR>
Biker Bob has some things to say:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Unless you're asking for a tattoo, don't bug me. I ain't got time for chit-chat.
