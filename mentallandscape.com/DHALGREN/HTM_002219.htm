&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA pear, too ripe, too sweet to be held by mother's arms, falls from the boughs at the waning of summer. Like the pear, Lachesis' warm face bears too much flavour to remain untasted or untainted. Again like the fallen fruit, her smile holds radiant innocence, while her eyes tell of passions plumbed. Her voice evokes the decadance and the delerium of living.
