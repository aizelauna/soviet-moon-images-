&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe shadowy nave stretches out at your back. Ahead of you the ruins of a baroque cross thrust into the dusty air. The timbers of the cross and the remains of a pupit are blackened from fire damage. Glittering chunks of melted stained glass litter the floor along with various debris.
