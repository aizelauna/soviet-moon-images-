&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFlashing strands of red tree lights strung across the ceiling fill the hallway with a pulsing crimson glow.  The walls are entirely covered with pages ripped from fashion magazines, scotch-taped to the dirty, peeling paint, face after beautiful face.  Small black lines seem to swarm across the glossy covergirls; it must be a trick of the light.  You squint at the closest picture:  sucksucksucksucksucksuck, meticulously lettered, slicing across pouting lips.  The picture behind you: bikini on the beach, titstitstitstits.  Every curling-cornered picture covered with tidy little words, you can't possibly read them all.  You focus on the gasoline can in the far corner of the hallway; it's not moving.

You make your way down the hallway to the fire-door, trying not to look at the blank staring faces.
