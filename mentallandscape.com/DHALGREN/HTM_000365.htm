&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo make new rooms belonging to you, use the @dig command:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @dig "Burning Hallway"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @dig "Smoke-Filled Room"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor each room you @dig, its object number will be reported (for example #100, #101). 
 You may need to know object numbers, and you can always find them by typing "@audit", 
for a report on the things you own.  A new room is unconnected to anything by exits, 
but you can go to it by teleporting:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @go #100
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe room can be described by "@describe here as ... " or by "@notedit here".  Be 
sure to include brief cues to where exits will be, like "To the north, a fire escape 
is visible through the window."  Don't make descriptions too long or they will tire 
the user and make it hard to find the exit cues.
