&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a porcelain dish packed with sections of roast veal shank on a bed of lentils and tomato sauce.  There is a little meat on each segment of bone, and the center is filled with the succulent baked marrow.
<BR>
You smell the aroma of brazed veal shank and lentils.
<BR>
You sample the lentils and then go to work on one of the shank-bone sections.  The meat on the outside is so tender it falls off the bone as you fork into it.  Finally the osso buco itself -- you scoop out the baked marrow with a small spoon and savor its rich flavor.
