&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA rare issue 526! This one must be worth a mint! RatMan has a run-in with an anti-polarity beam that makes him loose his super powers! The Cockroach somehow convinces the citizens to elect him as mayor! In the stunning cliff-hanger ending, RatMan seems like he is about to have his head cut off by a wood-splitting machine.
