&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   An old and abandoned church....strangely, tho, you can feel a strong presence, as if the Gods had not abadonned this holy place, even if the humans have.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStrange and beautyful statues, images of long forgotten faiths, adorn the walls. Yet, it's impossible not to notice the degradation, the broken and rotten stools, the dirty floor, the several needles...left as the remains of other faiths? You wonder.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCompletly out of place, but adding to the aura o misticism and mistery, lays in the altar a huge, apparently metalic, egg. The egg seems to emanate peace and relaxation, and you can't avoid going back to a feeling of safety you have never expericed in your whole life...or have you?
