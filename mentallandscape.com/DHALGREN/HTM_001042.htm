&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspScattered light skimpers into this small dry space formed by the slanting shapes of broken concrete slabs and iron bars from the ruins above.  The floor is covered by the remnants of large hardwood doors, the kind that could have been the entrance to a church or a government building of some sort.  The walls, falling inwards and outwards, have been decorated with the blue and black of tar and oil from the bits of pavement lying around the room.  Outlines and line drawings of androgynous figures in dancing poses have been formed in a circle around each wall.
