(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000003.htm">generic room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000277.htm">Amber-Jessica</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEchoing corrugated steel vault, dull reverb throb of the Honda portable
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgenerators outside.  Mingled smell of gasoline and Love's Baby Soft.  Halogen
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplamps hung from the support beams twist very, very slowly in the draft.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLittered around the vast semicylinder's dirt floor are rusted metal cargo
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdrums with a spray-stenciled shipping address:  "Trend Industries, Monrovia,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLiberia."  Although decrepit, the drums are sealed, making it impossible
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto determine their contents.  Several of them have been rolled away from 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe center of the floor to make room for a star-shaped pink linoleum
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcutout roughly three meters in diameter.  Upon it you see Amber-Jessica's
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHello Kitty slumber bag, which is surrounded by tattered back issues of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp_Tiger Beat_, _Mandate_, _Sassy_, and _Guns & Ammo_.  The northern arm
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof the star points to a small gray industrial safe whose door is covered with 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspglow-in-the-dark magnetic letters of various styles and sizes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large and badly corroded hangar door to the south bears a hand-painted
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsign reading "DO NOT LEAVE FORKLIFTS RUNNING UNATTENDED."
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_000277.htm">Amber-Jessica</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ south ] <A HREF="HTM_000305.htm">Concrete Lot</A>.
Corroded bearings squeal as you roll the door aside and step out.
