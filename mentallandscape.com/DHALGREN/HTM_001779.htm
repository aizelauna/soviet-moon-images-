<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspActually, this pale, rubbery chicken isn't so super after all. A note tied to the 
chicken, addressed to the Cosmic Muffin (the writer's deity of choice), explains 
that this is actually the Thanksgiving Chicken that Beatrice (pronounced Beat Rice) 
Harvey cooked just for her husband Ralph, but that Ralph did not believe the chicken 
to be edible, but that he DID believe it to be an oh-so-worthy sacrifice, and so 
threw it into the Pit when his wife wasn't looking.
