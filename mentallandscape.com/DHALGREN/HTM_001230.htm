After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe role of the Critic may not be to evaluate or judge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOriginally 'Critic' might have been 'Accuser'.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCritic accused in the law courts or declaimed in the market square.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAccuser (Satan) argues through a phase of human development.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlake has written of this in The_Marriage_of_Heaven_and_Hell.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Cf. Blake on contraries, etc.)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tyranny of contraries, of either/or, is an expression of the predominance of the sense of abstracted vision.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhat Blake foresees is their Marriage as the visual sense breaks out into seeing the what is.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs happens for a True Poet, or for all at such times as new forms and ratios of senses develop.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is treated in McLuhan as in other fascinating synthetics.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut before the stage of culture in which dialectic predominates, Critic is Servant of Trickster/Hermes:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCritic's play is to help the different sides talk.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCritic brings the kings to know the artists; offers ritual service to the priestesses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTelling and showing, interpreting, heralding, valuing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCritic favors the give and take of speaking and listening.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd Critic favors silent trade.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs a crosser of boundaries the Critic is akin to the shaman, finding reconciliations in the tribe.
