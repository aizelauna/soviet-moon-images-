&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The paranoid creates the world he knows around him.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It has order: this fits to that, and explains it.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Everything I see is determined so, and it makes per-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fect sense. Too perfect. My name, and my teacher's,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp has a significance complete and sufficient for the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp imagination, and so does every name and every action.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Like a giant pun.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The real act of creation will be when the paranoid
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp gives life to all this.  Give it up, let it make no
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sense.  It doesn't matter that so-and-so shook your
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp hand like this, stood stooping and muttered, polite.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspINTRANSFORMATION #3
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Giant Pun.  The Giant Pun is an allegorical figure.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe stands for Allegory.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Giant Pun strides over the land picking up trucks
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand cows and lifting the roofs off of houses. Pun is
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstupid, but powerful. He looks salaciously at the bride,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspgrinning, to place her in his pocket with his string and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspchange, to play with later.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust so he grasps the mind's desire.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Giant Pun says: "Allegory. Other-speaking.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A representation of an obscure, complex or elusive
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp sense by an apparent sense." It is the Giant's nature
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to seek to control and dominate the beautiful and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp delicate, massing it in his clumsy paw. "Ahh," he
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp says, "I will call you Elusive. Playing away."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCan it occur to the Giant that he himself, looked at
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspin a certain way, may be beautiful? His sense is after
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspall his own, however much he may embrace the world in it.
