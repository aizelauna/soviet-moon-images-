&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp           THE PIRATES' PLANET
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow their journey was nearing its happy end,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  for the Air Sprite pointed out to them,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    through an opportune gap in the encircling stars,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     the tiny Orb that was the Wonder World of Mars;
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and he named them the planets as they journeyed.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    There the sinister cruel world of Chinese legend,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and beyond that the beautiful Star of DreamsComeTrue,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  till for curiosity they landed on the Pirates Planet,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhich is very famed amongst all the outer worlds.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  (... the fantasy continues ...)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere they saw the hardy spirits of all the Buccaneers
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and Pirates who sailed the fabled mains.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTheir ships were there also, and on the curving beach
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp fronting the sunny seas they buried again
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp their gleaming treasures.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  (... the fantasy continues ...)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the sea was filled with the glory of their ships,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand the land with the splendour of their jewels;
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand they fought their ancient and dishonourable battles over again.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut harmless were these joys,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfor nothing here was real,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand all was dim and mystic,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand not more clear than the romantic memory that our Earth holds
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp of all those desperate men.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    [William Timlin, THE SHIP THAT SAILED TO MARS, 1923]
