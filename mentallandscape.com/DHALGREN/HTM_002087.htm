&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA memex is a device in which an individual stores
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspall his [sic] books, records, and communications,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand which is mechanized so that it may be consulted
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith exceeding speed and flexibility. It is an
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspenlarged intimate supplement to his memory.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt consists of a desk, and while it can presumably
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbe operated from a distance, it is primarily the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppiece of furniture at which he works.
