<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlack eyes without pupils stare back at you, and a knowing
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspalmost-smile graces an aged face of indeterminate ancestry. As
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou look on, he meditatively strokes his dirty-grey beard, tightly
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcurled in the fashion of Babylonian statuary. His gnarled hands are
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdeeply stained with ink, as his unwashed off-white robe. There is a
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvague smell of heady smoke of some kind about him, and his teeth
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspare stained a deep nut-brown color. He simultaneously conveys to you
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspan aura of deep seriousness, anger held in check, and a touch of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmischief.
