&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDark shadows cloak the corners of this small area. Light from the outside doesn't get in here very well. From what you can see, The stone walls used to have decorations upon them. Blank areas the size of paintings, tattered remnants of velvet hangings, and broken bits of plaster are evidence of it. No graffiti mars the walls as you would expect despite the open door.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp These darkened doors are tall and look very heavy. Carvings of vines and filigree fill the surface. Ornate handles and an old lock mechanism also adorn them.

For a moment you panic as the door doesn't open at first. But finally it does and you slip out.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lining the opening in the north wall, which is most of the wall anyway, is a stone archway. Peaked at the top like the kind you might find a gothic cathedral.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001082.htm">Hall</A>.
You step through the archway into the hall.
