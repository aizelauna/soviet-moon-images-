(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000003.htm">generic room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001228.htm">Wizard</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is an undecorated room with plain white walls. They only interesting features to the room are the doorway to the north, and the door to the south. An administrator stands here, since he has no chair, desk, or couch to aid in his comfort in any way whatsoever.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Your view out the doorway is blocked by a reddish-brown curtain.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001747.htm">Temple Entryway</A>.
You go back out through the doorway, swishing the curtains as you pass.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The door to the south is closed.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001753.htm">The Trash Bin</A>.
You pass through the door, and are assaulted by an olfactory nightmare.
