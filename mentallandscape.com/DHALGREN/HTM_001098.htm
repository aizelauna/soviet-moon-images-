&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSoft illuminations from the single narrow window show you that this room is not bare. Old furniture sits on the cold marble floor. An large bed against the right wall being the largest. Other pieces include dressers, chests, and a vanity table. The window is narrow and closed, but you can see bars on the outside through the dirty glass. The bed is covered in old white silks and linens, but something isn't right. You notice a large dark stain in the middle of it. Even though the window is closed, a chill breeze blows past you.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A small wooden door, peaked at the top. Adorned with a small brass handle in the usual place.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_001094.htm">Narrow Hallway</A>.
You fumble with the handle for a moment until you get the door open and dash through.
