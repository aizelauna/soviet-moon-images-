&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a man standing motionless at a crossroads.  His eyes are fixed upon the earth, his arms crossed on his breast.  Two women, one on his right, one on his left, stand each with a hand on his shoulder, pointing out to him one of the two roads.  The woman on his right has a fillet of gold around her forehead: she personifies virtue.  The one on the left is crowned with vine leaves and represents the temptations of vice.  Above and behind this group the genius of Justice, borne on a nimbus of blazing light, is drawing his bow and directs the arrow of punishment at Vice.  The whole scene expresses the struggle between the passions and conscience.
