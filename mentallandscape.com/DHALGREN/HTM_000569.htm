&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTiles in midnight blue, celadon and silver trace sinuous patterns up six of the octagonal walls and domed ceiling. At the dome's apex an oculus opens to the sky. The spacious floor is paved in deep blue tiles. In the center, two oblong baths. In one the water lies still over the patterned tiles, and soaps, cloths and brushes of various sorts await within reach. In the other the water churns and bubbles. Standing wooden racks hold towels. Against one walls is a massage table; by the opposite, a wrestling mat strewn with fringed cushions in opulent patterns. The remaining two walls, parallel to each end of the pools, are entirely covered by two large mirrors.

<BR>
You step down into the warm, scented water.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Two baths glow blue in their azure-tiled depths and reflect fragrments of light on their surfaces. The water in one lies still, steam curling calmly from its surface. The other is a whirl and contending of currents that clash, blend, and flow into hot unity.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see the room and its contents multiplied again and again in the two facing mirrors.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An oblong of water glows blue in its azure-tiled depths. It lies still as glass, steam curling calmly from its surface.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The long, rectangular pool reflects fragments of light on its foaming surface. It is a whirl and contending of currents that clash, blend and flow into hot unity.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A large divan covered in soft, fringed rugs stands in a corner.
<BR>
<BR>

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In a wall next to one of the mirrors an archway is curtained in midnight blue shot with silver thread.

You go through the curtain. The air is suddenly cool and dry.
