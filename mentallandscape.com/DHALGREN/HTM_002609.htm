&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     You're standing on the edge of a high cliff....deep down, the sea waves crash against the rocks, and their sounds raise up to you. It's a bit cold, especially when the wind slaps you with its freezing hands, but you want to be here. You want to feel the slow hipnoze of the sea, its music enchanting your soul..
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTwo buildings exist here, in a striking contradiction. An old, abandoned church, now probably only used by bumbs and junkies, and a modern, hi-tech building, belonging to some big communications corporation...you can't avoid a sad smile when comparing the two constructions...what once was the answer, is now just a wreckage...new truths arise.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut the sea calls you, interrupting your thoughts...the enchantment is back...the waves call you, wonderful lovers wanting to take you in their arms...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe sounds of the sea seem to whisper "Jump...Run...Forget...", they invite...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSo...jump!
<BR>
