&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly a tiny portion of light from the north permeates this section of the hallway. Stumbling around in the darkness, you somehow feel that you are not alone here. Standing still and listening, you hear only the pounding of your heart piercing the silent shroud.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A stretch of hallway can be seen up north, lit by a single lamp hanging on the wall.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001101.htm">Narrow Hallway</A>.
You head towards the light somewhat confidently.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can't see it, but you can feel the smooth wood of a door breaking the stone barrier normally found to the west.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can see nothing but darkness, but can sense that there is no wall there.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_001109.htm">Darkness</A>.
You nerve yourself, sure that something is waiting for you there, and plunge ahead into the darkness.
