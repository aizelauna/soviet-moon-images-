&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAbout the size of a large room, Cleo was very lucky to find this box.  There is a large bed against one of the walls, and a large pile of newspapers beside it.  When it is cold Cleo lets Caesar sleep at the end of the bed so he can keep her feet warm.  When he has been bad he sleeps on the newspapers.  Caesar's leash hangs from a nail in the wall and a large crate takes up most of the lower corner of the room.

You kneel dutifully on the floor.

<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Caesar's leash is made from strong leather.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The large bed looks soft and cosy.  Cleo seems a little lost in it sometimes cos it's so big.  She loves having Caesar sleep at her feet when its cold to keep them warm.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is a large pile of newspapers that Caesar sometimes uses as a bed.  Cleo likes having him sleep at her feet though, so if he is curled up here you know he has been bad.
