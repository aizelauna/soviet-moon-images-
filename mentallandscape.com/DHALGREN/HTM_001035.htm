&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA huge map, painstakingly charted by hand. You can dimly see that
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit is vividly colored. It is covered with handwritten notations
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand scrawled messages in Swahili, English, Xhosa, Hausa, Kikuyu,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrench, Herero, Tuareg, Twi, Zulu, Arabic, Shona, Afrikaans, and a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphost of other languages; even in the languages which you know, you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcan understand little of what the note-taker has written.  You notice
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsome circles around several locations: Johannesburg, Harare, Murewa, 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVictoria Falls, Bulawayo, Accra, Nairobi, Kampala, Durban, Abeokuta,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand a number of other less definite marks and indentations around other
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplocations.
