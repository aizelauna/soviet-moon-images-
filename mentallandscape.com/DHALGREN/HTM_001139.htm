&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small, dark-haired woman with hazel eyes. She is a weaver of dreams. She is wearing a rose-colored shift of the softest washed silk which leaves her arms and legs bare. Through the opening in her shirt you can see the beginning of a tattoo - an intricate pattern of Celtic knots, starting above her heart and disappearing underneath her shirt. Her arms, legs and feet are bare. She wears a single garnet earring in her right ear which catches the light as she turns to smile warmly into your eyes. A bracelet encircles her right arm -- a braid woven of yellow, rose and white gold. A delicate thread of spun silver encircles her left ankle. She is joyous and serene and alive.
