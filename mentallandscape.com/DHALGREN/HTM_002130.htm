<H3> Tattoo Den (waiting room) (#2130)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000538.htm">Eclipse</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis room is dimly lit; a few flickering, bare bulbs dangle from the ceiling.  Above you, pipes and wiring are exposed to the room.  The floor below you is cold cement, hardly covered by the few pieces of dirty carpet scraps that are trying to hide it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDirectly in front of you, to the west, stands a black, waist-high counter, scratched and scuffed with wear.  It blocks off a small alcove that ends a few feet behind it.  A dented, silver metal folding chair sits behind the counter, standing unevenly on a broken leg or two.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe walls around you are brightly decorated, with barely an inch of blank wall to be seen.  Around the door behind you and on the wall behind the alcove are huge airbrushed murals.  They depict various scenes: beaches, skateboarders, voluptuous women, and fantastical beings and creatures, among others.  The walls to your left and right are plastered with posters of various tattoo designs, ranging from the everyday to the downright bizzare.  One that especially catches your eye is a life-size poster of a woman, covered from head to toe with color and design, looking like something from the Jim Rose Circus Sideshow that was once very popular.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt takes you a few minutes to take all this in, and you stand in the middle of the room, staring for a while.  Against one wall, you spy a couch that beckons you, looking very comfortable.
<BR>
<BR>
You sink into the couch.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A heavy looking wooden door, with a large pane of translucent glass set in it's middle.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000988.htm">Entrance Passage</A>.
You strain to open the heavy glass door, and finally make your way into the darkness beyond it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A solid-looking steel door, marked "Tattoo Chamber" in red, spray-painted stenciled letters.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_002128.htm">Tattoo Chamber</A>.
You nervously approach the door to the Tattoo Chamber, letting it slam shut behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a large steel door marked "Removal Chamber" in haphazard, dripped black spray-paint.

You head for the Removal Chamber, determined yet a bit worried.
