&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on a flag-stone terrace next to the mansion.  Wooden chairs with colored canvas webbing are set out.  Beyond the balustrade the rocks are licked over with moss and topped by birches, maples and, here and there, thick oaks.  Rain patters on the striped awning.  To the south, steps descend to a path.  To the east are sliding glass doors leading into the house.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is an aura here of a perpetual weekend outing in the country.  Calkins and his visitors seem to deny the existence of the injured city beyond the walls of the estate.
