&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPlayers can write interesting new commands and place them on special objects called 
FEATURE OBJECTS.  These commands can be incorperated with the commands built into 
your player object.  One popular feature is "stage talk", an ability you can acquire 
by typing "@addfeature #112".  Then:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif Guest types:   `calkins hello there!
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwe will see:      Guest [to calkins]: hello there!
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother popular feature is Carrot's "@rose" command, which shows you a map of exits 
leading from the room you are in.  You will need to use @rose to find your way out 
of this chamber!  So, type:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @addfeature #126
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @rose
