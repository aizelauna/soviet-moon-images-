&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInterzone's small but exotic zoo.  Across a wide moat is a small community of chimpanzees, watched over by a wary dominant male.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPROFESSOR: "Control addiction predates our species.  The so-called Alpha Male ape has climbed to the top by a combination of physical brutality and political strategy.  He has to be somewhat generous to maintain the communities support, but he is obsessed with having a monopoly on sex.  The mere *thought* of other apes mating is enough to enrage him!"

You follow the boisterous group east.

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the males displays an erection.  The alpha male sees this and charges him.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe alpha male notices a male and female are not present.  He takes off looking for them.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe alpha male knocks another chimp head over heals with a powerful slap.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe alpha male stands on a pile of rocks beating out a simple rhythm with sticks.  The others gather around to watch.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe alpha male stares down another male, his hair standing straight out makes him look huge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe alpha male breaks up a meeting between number two and number three male.
