&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see an old man who walks leaning on a stick and holding in front of him a lighted lantern half-hidden by his cloak.  This old man personifies experience acquired in the labours of life.  The lighted lamtern signifies the light of the mind which should illuminate the past, the present, and the future.  The cloak that half conceals it signifies discretion.  The stick symbolises the support given by prudence to the man who does not real his purpose.
