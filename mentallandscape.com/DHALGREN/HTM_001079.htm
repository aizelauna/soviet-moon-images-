&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Our private senses are not closed systems but are endlessly 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  translated into each other in that experience we call 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  con-sciousness. Our extended senses, tools, technologies, 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  through the ages, have been closed systems incapable of 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  interplay or collective awareness. Now, in the electric age, 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  the very instantaneous nature of co-existence among our 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  technological instruments has created a crisis quite new in 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  human history. Our extended faculties and senses now constitute 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  a single field of experience which demands that they become 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  collectively conscious. Our technologies, like our private 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  senses, now demand an interplay and ratio that makes 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  _rational_ co-existence possible. As long as our technologies 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  were as slow as the wheel or the alphabet or money, the fact 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  that they were separate, closed systems was socially and 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  psychically supportable. This is not true now when sight and 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  sound and movement are simultaneous and global in extent. A 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  ratio of interplay among these extensions of our human 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  functions is now as necessary collectively as it has always 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  been for our private and personal rationality in terms of our 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  private senses or "wits," as they were once called.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                     --Marshall McLuhan, THE GUTENBERG GALAXY
