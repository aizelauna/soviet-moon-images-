&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a drainage grate directly overhead providing a pitiful amount of light to see by.  Rats scurry away at your approach. The current isn't very strong but you can tell that it flows in the direction that you are currently thinking is northeast, but the light here doesn't extend very far down any tunnels and you're already completly turned around so direction doesn't matter much. There are tunnels branching off at all times, some flowing out of this one, some into it. The smell of the road gets more and more faint as you go further downstream, and the smell of stagnant sewage gets much stronger. You are currently walking on a shelf that allows you to stay out of the actual sewage.  There's a chill breeze coming in through the grate.
