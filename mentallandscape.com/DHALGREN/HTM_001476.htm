<H3> Drag-Strip Speedway (#1476)</H3>

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis was once a prominant section of a downtown metropolis, but now it lays in decay. Once grand office buildings lie in ruin on both sides of a suprisingly well kept street.  The strip runs north and south, and on the east side of the street is a dank little alley.  You notice the distinct smell of gasoline and oil that hangs heavily in the air.  You are also aware of the fact that farther south down the street a car seems to have plunged itself directly through a store front long ago and now sits rusting in the crumbling wall.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_002215.htm">Ipsol's Alley</A>.
You peer into the poorly lit alley and plunge into the darkness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001463.htm">Dockside</A>.
You turn and begin heading west toward the Dockside.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA swift wind rustles through the ruined buildings singing a mournful tune.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDown the street, you hear the shrill cackle of one of the drag queens soliciting the strip.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sickening stench rises up through the sewer grate by the curb at your feet, causing you to cover your mouth to prevent yourself from gagging.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the north, you could swear that you hear a radio being played.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the distance, you thought you heard a woman scream... maybe it was just the wind.
