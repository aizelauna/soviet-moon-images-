&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a tall thin man. His face is partially obscured by a battered black fedora, but the right side of his face seems a lot lighter than the other side. A pair of glowing green eyes stare back at you, so you quickly look the rest of him over. He is wearing a black, vested tuxedo. The vest is dark green, and the shirt is silvery grey. A heavy black cloak swirls about him, falling to his ankles. He is wearing a pair of battered black boots. The boots are steel-toed and laced up to mid-calf. In one hand he carries a heavy oak staff. The staff is capped in steel at both ends, and he swings it as if he really does know how to use it.
