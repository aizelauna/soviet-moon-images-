&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStripped of all it's finery, the altar still somehow seems to retain a touch of the holy.  Shreds of red velvet are all that remain of the carpet that used to cover the steps to the altar.  The kneeling pads that once surrounded the altar have been ripped into bits of cotton, and the wooden rails that once supported praying arms are long gone.  A battered crucifix hangs above the altar from one chain, and screaming obscenities cover the altar itself and the walls around this space.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe only space that seems untouched is directly behind the altar, where a pentacle is drawn in white chalk on the stone floor.  Here, you see candle wax at certain points on the pentacle, and the scent of incense lingers.  A few feet above you, an alcove in the wall houses a simple yet beautiful white marble statue of a woman, expression serene, arms outstreched.  She has been dressed in a blue gown, trimmed with silver, and waisted with a silver belt.  A crescent has been painted in blue paint upon her forehead.
