&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor as far as you can see, there are filing cabinets stuffed to overflowing with papers and random trash. The dust is thick and the lights are very dim. There is a stairwell to the east.  
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001501.htm">an elevator call button</A>, <A HREF="HTM_001966.htm">a little bird</A> and <A HREF="HTM_002453.htm">a little page</A> here.

Pushing papers and trashcans out of your way, you stumble past filing cabinets and enter the stairwell.
