&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are surrounded by swaying palm trees. Looking up you notice that these are no ordinary palm trees. While at first glance the coconuts appear average, you realize that these are special. These are the coconuts of a grrl's dreams: soft and smooth in their full roundness. Below the swaying coconuts, er . . .palms, there are several inviting hammocks tied to the palm trunks. You decide to relax in the purple, guest, rainbow, potsdam, flint, hula, Xville or sky hammock. Near the eastern shore on the Island's white sand beach, you see a weathered and inviting beach hut. A strong wind is blowing from the northwest. The air is freezing cold, but muggy. A light snow drifts gently from the sky.
