&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA broad marble floor reflects dim electric lights high above -- they must have a gasoline generator here.  On the north wall is an elevator framed in a radiating stainless steel design incorporating art-deco and ancient-Egyptian motifs.  To the east are the doors leading out to the street.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Tall doors of steel and broken-out glass lead to the street.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000161.htm">Broadway</A>.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000186.htm">Mayor's Office</A>.
You step into the elevator.  Before you can press any button, the doors close and it begins accelerating upward at an alarming rate.  At the top floor, #100, it stops and you get out.
