<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small Asian woman with high cheekbones and extravagantly lush lips. Her ink-
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblack hair is cropped short, and she has a tiny gold ring through one side of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher nose.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Articulated pieces of metal twine around her body. There are lots of pointy
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbits, mostly made of dull steel and bronze. You notice barbed wire, gears,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspglass tubes filled with oil, copper-wound armatures, quartz crystals and vacuum
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptubes incorporated into the design. It's quite revealing, but you'd probably
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcut yourself if you tried to touch her.
