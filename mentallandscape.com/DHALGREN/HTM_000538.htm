&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThough all the feelings that broke through that door
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspjust didn't seem to be too real.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe yard is nothing but a fence, the sun just hurts my eyes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomewhere it must be time for penitence.  Gardening at night is never where. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe neighbors go to bed at ten.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCall the prayer line for a change.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe charge is changing every month.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThey said it couldn't be arranged.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe ankled up the garbage sound, but they were busy in the rows.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWe fell up, not to see the sun, gardening at night just didn't grow.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI see your money on the floor, I felt the pocket change.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThough all the feelings that broke through that door just didn't seem to be too real.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour sister said that you're too young.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThey should know they've been there twice.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe call was 2 and 51.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThey said it couldn't be arranged.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a tall, pale woman, whose short burgundy curls hang halfway over her eyes.  Her lips are bright red, her nose delicate and slender, and her eyes, which look to be a solid dark blue, seem to flash at you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn a chain around her neck is a simple silver pentacle in a circle, with a tiny ankh in the middle.  In her ear is a small earring in the shape of a golden apple, with a "K" engraved in it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe seems to notice your gaze, and arches an eyebrow in response.
