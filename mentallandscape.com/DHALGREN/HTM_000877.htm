&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    We unfired vessels of the day,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Built of a soft, unechoing clay,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Grow obdurate of ear at night
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    When images of voice are bright:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    The dreamingale, the waterlark,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Within the present, silent dark
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Echo the burden (on these stairs
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Mistranslated) the singer bears--
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    He who packs, with a glowing faith,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    In one portmanteau, fame and death.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          --from John Hollander,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          "The Widener Burying-Ground"
