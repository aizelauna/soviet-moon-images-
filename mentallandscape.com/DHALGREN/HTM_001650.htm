&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lobby has been taken over by the fans and converted into a welcoming room for all the new visitors and convention regulars; plush couches invite you to rest your weary feet and tables are loaded down with miscellany. A small robot wheels about the room offering drinks, and bags of chips are scattered about the tables.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through glass doors you see the town square.
[ southeast ] <A HREF="HTM_001621.htm">Town Square</A>.
A man dressed up like Mr. Spock holds the door for you as you walk outside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There is a huge sunny atrium full of tubs of plants to the north.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001653.htm">Atrium</A>.
You stop to admire the red-and-black patterned skin of two cute female aliens as you wander north. You also wonder how long it will take them to get the paint off...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001647.htm">MedFaire Parking Lot</A>.
The door slides open as you step out into the bright light. You blink, momentarily disoriented, and look about.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through glass doors you see King Street.

You step over some fans sitting on the floor and head out to King Street.
