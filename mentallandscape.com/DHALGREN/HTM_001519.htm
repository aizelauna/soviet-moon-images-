&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself standing in a musty vault. Perhaps years ago, this place held treasures of the Church; maybe beautiful goblets, spare hymn books, jeweled sceptres...but now it holds nothing but dust, and a few small boxes stacked on one wall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspExamining the boxes closer, you can barely make out that they are moth balls circa 1943.

You see <A HREF="HTM_000883.htm">Soma</A> here.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a heavy wooden door, oddly out of place in this cramped room.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001515.htm">Tiny Alcove</A>.
Having taken as much of the stench as you possibly can, you move back out into the alcove, making sure to leave the door cracked as it had been before you entered.
