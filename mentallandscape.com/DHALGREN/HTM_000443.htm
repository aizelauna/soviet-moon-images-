&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWide cobbled paths converge at a raised, circular tank ringed with benches. Lined along the paths are elaborate Victorian animal houses, topped with crumbling domes and decorated with stone gargoyles of monkeys, intertwining snakes, lion faces. Some of the buildings have cages attached. The bars on the cages appear to have been pried apart. There don't seem to be any animals around... but perhaps if you looked closely...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is day. You feel chilled, as a light drizzle soaks through your clothes..
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The cages are uninhabited.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A dolphin appears at the tank's surface. She seems to smile at you, then submerges.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A green plastic bench, made of recycled soda bottles. An alligator is sleeping under it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A ring of green plastic benches, made of recycled soda bottles. A four-foot long alligator is sleeping under the one closest to you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Watch out... you're about to step in something very nasty!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Watch where you step... you're about to step in something very nasty!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cracking, crumbling, covered with unkempt vines. Your eye is drawn to the dome on the monkey house by a flash of pink...
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou feel the pinch of claws on your shoulder. A brilliant blue macaw has alighted there.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA trashcan clatters over, and a three-toed sloth slowly makes its way out.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA beautiful white wolf peeks warily at you from behind the monkey house.
