&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCoulibri Estate, Jamaica 1840's.  The sun PLAYs in a dance WITH shadows over the MASK

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp	    the ginger lilies and the roses, the rocking-chairs

After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOur garden was as large and beautiful as that garden in the Bible -
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                      the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                  tree of life
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                      grew
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                     there.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                      But it had gone wild.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe paths were overgrown and a smell of dead flowers mixed
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                               with the fresh living smell.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnderneath the tree ferns,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   t
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  a             as forest
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp l             tree ferns,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp l
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      the light was green.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                Orchids flourished out of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                        reach or for some
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                 reason not to be touched.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                  One was snaky looking,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                another like an octopus
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                         with long thin brown tentacles  bare of leaves
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                hanging
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                    from a twisted root.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp               Twice a year the octopus orchid flowered -
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                    then not an inch of tentacle showed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                       It was
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                  a bell-shaped mass
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                          of white, mauve, deep purples,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                                 wonderful to see.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                    The scent was very sweet and strong.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  I never went near it.
