&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is a large, gaunt grey dog with a brownish muzzle and a festering sore in his side.  His eyes are surprisingly intelligent and filled with pain and sadness.  He stays a safe distance from you and often seems to wince from invisible blows.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAround Lancelot's neck is a silver collar with a blue tag on it.  In neat white letters, the tag says, "Property of Shallott"

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002462_State2.htm">call</A> ] calls to Lancelot. Lancelot watches warily.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002462_State1.htm">feed</A> ] tries to feed Lancelot, but Lancelot refuses to come near.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002462_State4.htm">kick</A> ] kicks Lancelot. Lancelot leaps out of the way and begins a steady growling.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002462_State2.htm">pet</A> ] reaches out a hand of friendship to Lancelot. Lancelot backs away, eyeing the hand warily and occasionally flinching.
