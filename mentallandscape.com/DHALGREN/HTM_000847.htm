&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA series of bare bulbs suspended from the cracked and waterstained ceiling floods the narrow hallway with dirty yellow light.  The grimy greyish paint on the walls flakes away at your touch, and the plaster underneath is soft and rotten.  The threadbare carpet from the lobby continues down the hallway, edges curling with damp and revealing missing tiles in the filthy white mosaic of the floor.  The elevator, which looks as if it may still work, is on the south wall.  The door to the firestairs is at the east end of the hall, and you notice the sounds of occupancy to the north, northeast, and southeast.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The carpet leads back into the dim, fragrant lobby.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000189.htm">Lobby of Labry Apartments</A>.
You make your careful, disgusted way back into the lobby.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ north ] <A HREF="HTM_002249.htm">#17</A>.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ south ] <A HREF="HTM_002256.htm">Elevator Shaft</A>.
You get onto your knees at the sill, holding the edge, dropping first one leg down, then the other.  Your shin scrapes the basement door-sill.  Your foot hits something and slips, in either grease or blood.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_002261.htm">Ground Floor Landing</A>.
You manage to make your way to the end of the hall without tripping on the uneven carpet. After struggling with the handle of the fire-door for a moment, you are able to push it open with your shoulder and step into the landing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ ne ] <A HREF="HTM_002278.htm">#19</A>.
You walk into room #19.
