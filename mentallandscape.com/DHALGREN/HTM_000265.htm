&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA narrow, rough-hewn tunnel stretches out before you into the gloom. The floor is dry, dusty and littered with shards of stone, pottery and what looks like bones. The walls appear to have been dressed stone at one time, but now all that remains is the crumbling shell of symbol painted white plaster.There is a soft, musty breeze blowing towards you from the shadows.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000177.htm">Ruined Church</A>.
You climb the debris-choked stairway back up to the church.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ s ] <A HREF="HTM_000268.htm">Catacombs</A>.
You carefully pick your way down the tunnel to the south.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear something moving in the darkness ahead of you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cool, dry wind stirs the hair on your head...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOff in the distance you see a ghostly flicker of light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRock falls from the ceiling of the tunnel and hits the tunnel floor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGhostly luminescence shines from the walls of the tunnel.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLuminous moss--growing in the carving on the walls--glows a sickly green.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear noises in the tunnel behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDebris falls in the church over your head; dust clouds the air around you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear something moving in the darkness
