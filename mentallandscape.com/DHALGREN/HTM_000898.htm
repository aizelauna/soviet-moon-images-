(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000812.htm">Marcus</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn here is a little office. A desk is piled high
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with an aging electric typewriter, stolen books
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and a mess of lists and typescripts all overdue
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp for rejection letters. Posters announcing shows
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in productions long past are peeling from walls
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and doors. In a corner is a spot laid out, with
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a cushion on a rug, just to sit down in.
<BR>
<BR>
You sit down on a cushion in the corner.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001154.htm">a stage trunk</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000878.htm">Diogenes</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A door leads out.
[ out ] <A HREF="HTM_000823.htm">Backstage</A>.
You go out through the door.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 1. First, train in the preliminaries.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 2. Regard all dharmas as dreams.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 3. Examine the nature of unborn awareness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 4. Self-liberate even the antidote.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 5. Rest in the nature of alaya, the essence.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 6. In postmeditation, be a child of illusion.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 7. Sending and taking should be practiced alternately. These two should ride the breath.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 8. Three objects, three poisons, and three seeds of virtue.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 9. In all activities, train with slogans.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp10. Begin the sequence of sending and taking with yourself.
