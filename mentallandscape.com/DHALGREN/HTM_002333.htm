&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the literal constipated bowels of the building lies the boiler room, long since defunct and now seemingly serving as housing only to the rats. But upon closer inspection you spot a collection of trophies in a corner: Rat skulls, the ribcage of a large bird, feathers tied together with a string, a copy of the dreaded Knifeline book. Bric-a-brac of a dark nature, it indicates that something lingers here occasionally. One can only hope that it will return if one waits long enough.
