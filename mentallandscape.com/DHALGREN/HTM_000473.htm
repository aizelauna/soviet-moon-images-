&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIssue 356, the first time Cyclopath made an appearence. Mucho value. Cyclopath tracks Ant-head Man back to his secret lair. Cyclopath and Ant-head Man have 12 pages of horrific battle! In the stunning cliff-hanger ending, Cyclopath seems like he is about to have his head cut off by a giant deli-slicer.
