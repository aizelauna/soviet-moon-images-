&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA ruined place of peace: once a small and private plot for the wealthy, but now a sprawl of barbed wire and broken gravestones. Graffitti covers the few intact tombs. Everything is dying here, everything is in a constant and eternal state of decay. A low and chill mist hangs over everything, dulling the ever present smell of stale sex, ozone and opium. A low Mausoleum sits in the centre of the Graveyard, its doors sullenly beckoning you (in). To the west lies a small hill, shrouded in the cold tendrils of the mist. To the south west, just beyond a line of thorn bushes you can make out the bleak strip of Broadway. In the oily drizzle, the sunlight filters through the mist.

You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Long dead traces of g(host)s in the machine. These are the bones that built the temple of virtuality. Jack in, jack off. Collapse is a fetish. Don't believe a word they tell you. Hate the body - go electric. These are the days when immortality is at our fingers. Other obselete slogans. Smashed stones and fleeting ghosts.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Undead metallic screech of ectoplasm - a brush of wet skin on dying metal. A smell of broken connections and the bondage of bandwidth. The mist could almost be alive - if you let it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dull metal rust blood cable linking foreign machines into a panopticon of denial. Denial of access, of warmth, of humanity. Woven into beautiful shapes: Mandelbrot would be proud. The wire must link together baroque terminals of sub-future grid surfers. It looks a lot like a vast network of chains.

You tear loose from clutching limbs of wire, and head up a small hill.

You stumble through the throrn bushes, scramble over a broken fence, and leave the graveyard.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVoices from far off reach you, the shouting dulled by the mists.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is the dull throb of punk rock drifting from the Mausoleum.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mist clings to you, leaving a wet sheen across your body
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTumbling shapes and strange attractors appear in the mist, collide and disappear.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomewhere in the debris, a rattlesnake sounds coldly. Or maybe that's the bones of the restless dead, calling for body heat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA black trail of thin smoke enters the Mausoleum.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA black trail of thin smoke leaves the Mausoleum.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA gravestone suddenly cracks and splinters. A shard of stone lands somewhere near your feet.
