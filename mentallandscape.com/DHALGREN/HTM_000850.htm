&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe _locus_amoenus_, to which we now pass,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                        has not previously been recognized
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspas possessing an independent rhetorico-poetical existence.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Yet, from the Empire to the sixteenth century,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit forms the principal motif of all nature description.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  It is, as we saw, a beautiful, shaded natural site.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Its minimum ingredients comprise
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                a tree       (or  sever   tree
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                     al     s),
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp a meadow, and a     spring
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                        or brook.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Birdsong        and          flowers    may be added.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe most elaborate examples
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                            also add a breeze.

Discontented with the complacencies of a merely literary pleasance? Rush, thrust, vault into Cyberspace...
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAmidst the foliage bright-hued birds concord,                                  sweetly a song of finding all in each.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAbove you rise the weaving boughs of elms.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe shade encloses everything in green.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA vista stretches, easement for the eyes--                                    a meadow, gold and green, and hills behind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe philosophic muse reflects on love.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA lone cicada saws and sings his mind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA burbling spring sings silver in the pool...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspZephyr whispers, "All there is of warmth."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDown from the spring a brook steps -- washes on.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGreen turf fresh mown gives forth its sharp sweet scent.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen abstract words, conceptions govern sense.
