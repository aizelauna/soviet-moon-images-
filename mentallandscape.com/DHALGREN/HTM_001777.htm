&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe pit seems to consume the easternmost end of this cavernous place, filling the rest with smoke and shadow, casting a reddish light up toward the ceiling. Looking into the pit, you can't tell how deep it is; you can only make out the presence of some great fire down below. Oddly-shaped, the edges of the pit are rough, with many outcroppings sticking out from the sides, especially toward the top. The pit's heat covers you with a glaze of sweat.
