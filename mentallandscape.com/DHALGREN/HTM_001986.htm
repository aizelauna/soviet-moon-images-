&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe GPCIC is a simple integrating player class.  It basically integrates into a player's description anything in eir contents that has a .carried_msg.  This is a simple and useful form of integration, in that it allows the player to integrate any object into eir description, including clothing, weapons, jewelry, food, knapsacks, pets, or anything that has a .carried_msg or that the player puts a .carried_msg on.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe GPCIC is a child of the Useful Utilitarian PC (#99), and therefore does not have the features of the Scorpion or Lycanthropic PCs.  However, player classes with additional features can easily be @parented or @chparented to this one to inherit the integrating ability.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe GPCIC is a simple integrating player class.  It basically integrates into a player's 
description anything in eir contents that has a .carried_msg.  This is a simple and 
useful form of integration, in that it allows the player to integrate any object 
into eir description, including clothing, weapons, jewelry, food, knapsacks, pets, 
or anything that has a .carried_msg or that the player puts a .carried_msg on.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe GPCIC is a child of the Useful Utilitarian PC, #99, and therefore does not have 
the features of the Scorpion or Lycanthropic PCs.  However, player classes with additional 
features can easily be @parented or @chparented to this one to inherit the integrating 
ability.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you own an object which does not have a .carried_msg but that you would like to 
have integrated into your description while you are carrying it, adding a .carried_msg 
is an easy thing to do.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEclipse wants her skull (#909) to be integrated into her description while she's 
carrying it, but it doesn't have a .carried_msg property.  To do this, she simply 
types:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@prop #909.carried_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@carried #909 is Visitor seems to be carrying a large, smiling skull in one hand.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy adding the property and setting it, the .carried_msg of the skull will now be 
seen in her description whenever she carries the skull.  This can be done with just 
about any object that you'd like mentioned in your description instead of your contents 
list, and has many uses.
