&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis was noce where subway trains loaded and unloaded passengers. All that remains now is a set of rusty tracks and rotted wood between them. The loading ramps are covered in graffiti, most of which is faded and stained by stagnant water. The concrete is chipped and broken, missing large chunks in some places and being covered in a spider's web formation of fissures in others. Across from the loading ramp there is a large hole in the wall of the subway, from which the smell of sewage eminates. The tunnels to either side have collaped. The once exits to the surface have also long since caved in, and the debris looks highly unstable. The echos of your footsteps cause small marble-sized stones to cascade down the slopes of the larger boulders, and the whole system seems ready to consume anyone walking too clase. The air is damp, chill, stagnant, and pungent. There is one dim lightbulb lighting the entire area, whith shadows being the most predominant feature. Deep shadows. Black shadows. Against one sturdy wall is a largh cardboard box, which is soggy but standing. It looks large enough to fit 2 people inside, and there is an old wool blanket draping out of the opening in it.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hole to the other side of the tracks is large enough to fit several people in, all lying down. The bottom and sides of this hole are covered in a blackish thick liquid, and the smell belies a sewer. There is the sound of slowly moving water on the other side of the hole, but there is little to no light.

You overcome the revulsion from the stench eminating from the hole, and proceed through.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The enterance to the box is mearly what was the top, now on a side. The current top of the box visibly sags down, and there's a horribly rotten smell eminating from the opening.

You drop to all fours and crawl into the box.
