(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000110.htm">Generic Post-Apocalypse Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001457.htm">Trismegistos</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA vast, desolate expanse of poured concrete with occasional asphalt patches,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp an unmarked, titanic graveslab carved by Technology for Nature. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe sun rides high in the sky. Lacking drainage, the plain is ankle-deep in water from the rain.
<BR>

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe howling of the wind forms meaningless words in your ears.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wind blows a discarded coffee-cup sipping lid across the Solitude.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wind stops for a moment, then picks up again.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomewhere far off, metal clinks on metal.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou notice that something is hissing invisibly out of a crack in the concrete.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tiny, metal, nanoengineered robot cockroach darts between your feet.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wind blows an empty "JUST SAY NO" plastic shopping bag across the Solitude.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wind scuds a fringe of grit across the engineered surface.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou definitely see a flame hovering over the horizon, off to the south.
