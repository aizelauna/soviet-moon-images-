&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are on the back deck of the Chantry. There is an umbrella covered table here, and several lawn chairs. A large door to the west leads back to the kitchen, while double doors in the northwest and southwest lead to the Disciple's Chambers and the Dining Hall respectively. To the east looks to be a large hedge maze...
