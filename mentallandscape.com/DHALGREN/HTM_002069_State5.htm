<H3>Holy Mother (#2069): angry</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHer full fury shows now, and the Holy Mary, Mother of God is nearly aflame with anger.  Her radiant aura burns hotter than anything you've seen before and all she touches seems to ignite from mere contact.  Still naked, her lack is clearly not an invitation but an expression not only of her strength and anger, but also her Godly competence and omnipotence.  Don't push her further, or you may not exist long enough to realize you've done wrong.
