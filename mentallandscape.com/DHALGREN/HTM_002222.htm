&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn oval room with a domed ceiling and walls of an alien black metal. Your reflection in them is darkly opalescent. Luxuries no longer obainable by honest means are hoarded here, a sofa and chairs covered with fragrant black leather, a table of curved black glass, a thick, antique carpet patterned with deep crimson and purple. Curved shelves are full of books, and over a bed of curious design an arched window looks over the figments and abberations if the Interzone to a rainy sea in an unlikely day.
<BR>
<BR>
You stretch out on the bed.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Its headboard, a curious asymmetrical spiral of black iron, is streaked with silver, its white blanket woven of soft wool from the local long-haired sheep.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A pointed archway is curtained by a tapestry of midnight blue woven with silver.

You push aside the curtain. Fragrant warmth meets your face.

This place has a certain ambiance...
