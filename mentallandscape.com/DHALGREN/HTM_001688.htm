&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can go to the desk to register for a room or pick up duplicate room keys. Beyond the desk is a door labelled Manager to the north. Glass doors go out to the street to the east, and the room opens out into the atrium south. To the west are the elevators for the North Tower.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There is a veritable jungle of potted plants in the atrium to the south.

You are nearly knocked over by a hyperthyroidal gofer, but you make it safely into the airy atrium.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The door slide open to allow a cluster of fans in while you watch. Beyond them, you see the busy traffic of King Street.

You step over some sleeping fans and emerge on King Street.
