&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour gaze finds exactly the ramshackle cement-block & pine 2 x 10 shelves you expected 
to see, crammed haphazardly full of precisely the sorts of books you would have guessed 
were there.  Looking closer you notice among the anarchists and Marxists a handful 
of Nietzsche and Weber, next to the feminist texts threatening Freud's collected 
works on a lower shelf.  Some larger, tattered volumes catch your eye on the bottom 
shelf; upon inspection these turn out to be various omnibus guides to movies and 
records.
