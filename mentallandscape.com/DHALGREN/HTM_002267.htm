&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDirty wallpaper printed with what looks like a forest scene hangs in tattered strips from the corridor walls. Someone has drawn gaunt and twisted faces peering out through the gaps in the trees; the trapped eyes watch your progress as you walk down the hall, skirting piles of what you hope are animal bones, your footsteps echoing on the cracked concrete floor.
