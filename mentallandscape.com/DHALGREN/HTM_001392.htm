&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe few lit candles that flicker at the door and various alcoves do little to illuminate this gloomy stretch from the front doors to the altar, which lies at the distant end of the aisle.  The sound of scurrying rats and something dripping echoes loudly from the high, vaulted ceiling to the cold stone floor underneath your feet.  The stone pews on either side of you lie in disorder, on their backs, against one another, or crumbling silently into dust.  Little light filters through the remains of the once-elegant stained glass windows, and shreds and tatters are all that remains of the silk banners that once adorned the walls.  Vandals have left their mark here, too, and colourful profanity litters the walls, pews, and floor.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Three sets of solid, oaken doors, the middle set being the largest, seem to be the exits from the cathedral.
[ northeast ] <A HREF="HTM_001005.htm">Cathedral Steps</A>.
You begin to sweat as you push with all your might on the doors. Finally, they give way, and open with a hideous squeak as you step outside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Your vision focuses on the distant end of the nave, where the altar stands.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001002.htm">Cathedral Altar</A>.
Your footsteps echo as you walk the long distance to the altar.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a heavy oak door, stained so dark it almost looks black. Here and there, you can see a scratch or a welt in the fine grain.
[ southwest ] <A HREF="HTM_001402.htm">Stairwell</A>.
Curiously, you open the basement door. The door creaks on it's hinges, but grudgingly allows you to pass through.
