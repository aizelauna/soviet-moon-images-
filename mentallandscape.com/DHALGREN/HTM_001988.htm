&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSaul is a scruffy throwback to Biblical times.  He shuffles along barefoot with his battered walking stick and his burlap sack, which looks ages old and is stained and dirty.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe himself is dressed in brown burlap, which seems to be wrapped around him in some sort of toga style.  He has tied a rope around his waist to keep the cloth from falling off, but it seems it might just fall apart anyhow.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHIs face and body are as scruffy and dirty as the burlap sack he carries, and you feel as if you can see the vermin that must crawl upon his dirt-soaked skin.  He shoots a toothless grin your way, and starts to hobble towards you.
