<H3>Trix (#1385): angry</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWeirdly lavender black-rimmed eyes return your gaze. Her face is powdered dead white, lips carefully painted the color of a fresh bruise. Her glistening silver hair is bound in two tight braids, the tip of each plait dyed to match her contact lenses.  Small silver rings sparkle at her nose, eyebrow, and lower lip, as well as completely lining both ears.  Trix wears a skintight long-sleeved black vinyl jumpsuit with a pair of black thigh-high boots, standing easily on 5-inch heels.  Through the tightly stretched vinyl you can see the small circles of her nipple rings.
