&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDaylight seems to cast shadowy impressions of real life onto the high limestone walls.  To the east is a wide archway leading out, and to the west is a narrow passage leading further into the cave.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspType "read sign" to get started.  The two signs here are about navigating through virtual reality.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn annoyed Neanderthal comes out of the cave and deposits a Cave Entrance here.  
He grunts and returns into the depths of the cave.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a dark narrow-looking tunnel leading deep into the cave.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000349.htm">Crystal Cave</A>.
You venture into the passageway, glad you have a head lamp now!

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000011.htm">River bank</A>.
You emerge from the cave.
