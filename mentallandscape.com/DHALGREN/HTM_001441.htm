&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspArrived Interzone Aug 14 '94. finding it a strange place so far. 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A lot of curious types about, but nobody particularly interested in talking
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTried the cafe, market and University. No heads, hops or black meat.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI'm beginning to wonder what a body does for kicks around here
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOr perhaps there's a squares convention in town .....
