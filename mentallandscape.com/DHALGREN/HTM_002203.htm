<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you're here to get a tattoo, take a seat on the couch.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you're here to watch, plant yourself in the chair.  And don't bother Bob.  You'll 
piss him off.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you're ready to get your tattoo, simply `ask Bob for tattoo', and Bob will take 
it from there.  Enjoy.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThanks.
