&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou shiver as you see the caress, feel it.

After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The excellence of a caress
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     here and then gone...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  a word strokes time and space,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     fixing itself a moment
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     as a tangible thing:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     my breath on your body.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  This new form is the most ancient of forms--
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     long before epic songs, long
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  before tales were told
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     we rested by,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     our hands on other's hip,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and crooned to each other.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  So in our words touching on a moment's passing
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  our breaths even as an even morning.
