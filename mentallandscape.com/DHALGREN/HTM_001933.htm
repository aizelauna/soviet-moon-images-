&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLooking closely at the statues, you can't see a single difference between one and the next; however, each seems to be a grim parody of the one before. They eagerly lean far over the ledge, as if ready to lunge down upon newcomers. They possess long, claw-like fingernails, wild hair, and a grim facial expression, though in their jewelled eyes you sense infinite pleading.
