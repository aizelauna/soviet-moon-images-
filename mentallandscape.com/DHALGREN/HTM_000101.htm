HELP MANUAL:

<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Generic Edible Object (GEO) is the simplest of a class of edible, feelable, smellable 
objects.  After making a child of this object, you set the following messages:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   smell_msg          - what player reads when he does "smell <object>"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   taste_msg          - what player reads when he does "taste <object>"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   feel_msg           - what player reads when he does "feel <object>"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   eat_msg            - what player reads when he does "eat <object>"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   drink_msg          - what player reads when he does "drink <object>"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   smoke_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   osmell_msg         - what others see when player smells the object.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   otaste_msg                  etc, etc...
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   ofeel_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   oeat_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   odrink_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   osmoke_msg
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   delayed_eat_msg    - delayed action after eating, drinking or smoking.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf delayed_eat_msg is a string, it will be displayed to the player after 12 seconds. 
 If it is a list of strings, randomly selected strings will be displayed to the user 
starting in 12 seconds and spaced 15 seconds apart.  In that case, the number of 
messages shown will be the square root of the length of the list of strings.  The 
chances of seeing a duplicate are then fairly rare.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGEO is a child of Dred's Generic Boomerang Object.  See help for that generic to 
set automatic return-to-home behavior for edible objects.
