<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cool breeze blows past you from some unknown source.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou sense that you're being watched.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe building creaks and settles around you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou feel eyes staring at the back of your head.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear movement somewhere off in the shadows.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOut of the corner of your eye, you catch something white moving, but when you turn to look, you see nothing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor a moment, you distinctly heard someone calling your name.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSuddenly, a chill runs up and down your spine.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomething brushes up against you, startling you. But nothing is there.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe floor beneath you shakes, and you steady yourself. But then notice that nothing else seems to have moved.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a loud thump upon the ceiling, as if something fell on the level above you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomething echoes from the distant reaches of the building, but you can't discern what sound caused it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe musty smell of dust reaches your nose.
