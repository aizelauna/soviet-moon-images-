&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe inside of this box is amazingly warm and you wonder with alarm what the black steam rising from a corner is from. There is a blanket here, partly strewn out the door, and a sack of rotting popatoes. Most of the potatoes are half eaten. Every so often a rat scurries out a chewed hole in the box. The box itself looks worse from the side than it did from the out. The steam has caused the ceiling to collapse halfway down the sides, and it drips the same black water that is the steam. You get a sick feeling as the smell and feeling of the place washed over you, and you wonder what manner of creature uses this place as a home, since there's an obvious depression in the bottom of the box where someone or something must sleep.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There's a small amount of flourescent light entering through the enterance, and the air out there is much preferred.

You get out of the box and away from the god-awful potatoes.
