&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA thirty-meter square of Astroturf, bolted to the concrete surface of the Solitude, serves as a central court for a collection of squat buildings.  In the middle of the artificial village green stands a flaming flagpole-beacon.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe paved-over desolation of Dog Solitude stretches away to the north.  Due south there is a filling station, and to the east you notice an open fire door in one of the buildings.  
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A length of steel piping stretching 20 feet straight up, festooned with a black banner on which a three-armed red symbol -- a triskelion? -- has been marked in red duct tape. From the top of the pipe issues a hissing yellow flame, an eternal gas jet, beacon to the surrounding wasteland.

You walk over to check out the fire door, which is propped open with a cinder block, and crane your neck to look inside.
