&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA high fence of iron bars separates this strip of park from the street running to the south. The park once had a walk and garden, but now it's all gone to seed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt either end is an old, wrought-iron gate. Hanging off the spikes on the eastern gate are some remnants of undergarments--old trophies of some kind?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's daylight. Something's squirming in the grass; the air hangs with rain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the park is an old wooden park bench, missing a slat but still serviceable.
<BR>

You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Look west to see the western gate; east to see the gate on that end.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Curious, aren't we?  Not only is there a pair of lace panties, not overly large, but a brassiere to match, about a B cup.  Too bad, they're out of reach.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The bench is a sturdy hardwood-and-ironwork park bench that looks like it's seen better days and better friends.  It'll fit five, or one stretched out...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sorry, try calling it just a bench...

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The eastern gate was forged to match the gate opposite.  By a mistress, seemingly...the piece looks like it belongs in a gallery.  Iron snakes and bugs trace along it, almost looking alive.  On the other side you can see a little street.  You're going to have to figure out another way to see what's hanging here...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The western gate was forged to match the gate opposite.  By a master, seemingly...the piece looks like it belongs in a museum.  Birds and flowers trace along it, almost looking alive.  On the other side you can see a ruined shell of a space, but quiet, leading you to contemplate...
