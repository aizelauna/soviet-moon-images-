&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                      Song of Bear
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "Well, I don't either," she snapped, "I don't know if it's
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsomethin' in our eyes, or our heads, or our bellies, or what.  I
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsponly know that it's got somethin' to do with the light, and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsince everybody around here goes to bed at about the same
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptime, and gets up at about the same time . . . do you under-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspstand how and why the geese go south?  Then why do you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphave to understand this?"
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  She puttered around the kitchen for a few minutes, sucking
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher lip, making tsk-tsk noises with her tongue, shooting
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsideways looks at me, and then she smiled and sat down at
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe table with me, and took my hand.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "Used to be women weren't allowed to go up the mountain
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdurin' their time.  Because of the bears.  Bears got big sharp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnoses, and they'd smell the blood of Womantime, and think
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit was a female bear, and try to mate.  Prob'ly didn't intend
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspany harm, but bein' hugged by a big male bear is a good way
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto wind up in bad shape.  So the waitin' house was always
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspprotected from the bears, and women stayed out of the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmountains."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "There was a young woman who obeyed all the laws of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcleanliness, and never went to the hills durin' her period, and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdid all the things we're supposed to do, but got loved by a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbear anyway.  What it was, the bear saw her, and just fell in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplove.  Just as soft, and sappy, and foolish as anybody is when
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplove lightin' hits her.  The bear figured the young woman
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwould be afraid, so it hid in the bushes and never tried to
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptouch her or speak to her, it just watched.  Watched with its
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplittle round eyes, and shook with love.  Watched the young
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwoman fishin' and watched her gatherin' berries.  Watched her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwalkin', and watched her laughin' for days.  Shakin' with love
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand feelin' there would never be any hope for this love."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  "Well, one day the young woman came back from gatherin'
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfood and she stopped at the freshwater pool and took a bath.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStripped off all her clothes, walked slowly to the pool, and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspswam around a bit.  Stood in the water halfway up her legs and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbent over to wash her face.  Lay back in the water and wash-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsped her hair.  Stood up with her hair drippin' wet down her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspback, and rubbed her body with soft sand, and twisted this
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
