(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_002458.htm">Shallott</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe is small and slightly built, appearing at first like a delicate china doll with her blonde hair and elfin face.  Her eyes are like sapphires, bright and cold and she smiles but rarely.  The ragged blue dress she is wearing was once a fine gown, but has since been ripped off above the knees and at the shoulder.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe wears a golden chain for a belt, and suspended from the belt is a steel blade in a silvery sheath.
