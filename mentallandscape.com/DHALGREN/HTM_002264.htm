&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe concrete walls of the second floor landing have been painted blood-red, the ceiling black. Exposed wires dangling from the ceiling explain the shards of lightbulb glass under your feet. Black votive candles lining the perimeter of the room fill the landing with a flickering, strangely perfumed light. You can follow the gloomy staircase either up or down, or escape through the fire-door under the shuddering green glow of the exit light on the west wall.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ down ] <A HREF="HTM_002261.htm">Ground Floor Landing</A>.
You carefully make your way back down the stairs.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_002267.htm">Hallway, Second Floor</A>.
Dizzy from the perfume that hangs heavy in the air, you fumble with the door for a few seconds before you're able to push it open and step out into the hallway.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ up ] <A HREF="HTM_002271.htm">Third Floor Landing</A>.
You nervously look up the staircase, and see only blackness above. You take a deep breath and start up the stairs.
