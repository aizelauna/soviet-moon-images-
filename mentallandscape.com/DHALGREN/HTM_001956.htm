&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou stand on a wide expanse of black-sand beach. To the east, ocean waves crash beneath the overcast sky. You see a few old wooden boats on the sand. Raising your hand to shade your view, you seem to see something far out in the water.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see woods with a narrow path.

You enter the woods and follow the path for some distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A shape is sticking up from the sea in the distance.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see some old but sea-worthy boats with oars.

You push one of the boats to the shore and into the water, hopping in as it clears the sand. You begin to row eastward.
