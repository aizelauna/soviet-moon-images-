&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou reach the end of the long hallway and find yourself standing in a small, nearly airless alcove. The lack of any natural light prevents you from seeing much. A tiny antique lamp resting on a scratched maple table seems to reflect dust particles rather than offer any real light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe scent of something quite unpleasant hangs faintly in the air. As you sniff, you are able to discern that it is most probably old moth balls tinged with a hint of something that smells similar to oregano.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a narrow hallway, leading back towards the center of the basement.

Walking back down the hallway, your nose wrinkles as the damp air wafts toward you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a heavy wooden door, oddly unmarred while everything else around it is scratched or dilapidated, cracked just enough to allow a little bit of yellow light to spread out into the alcove.

You push the door open even further, gagging as the smell of moth balls bombards your senses. Trying to disregard it, you put a hand over your mouth and nose and step in, closing the door behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a splintered wooden door. On it, is a faded sign which reads "Storage".

Your curiosity getting the better of you, you pull open the closet door and go in.
