<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you get lost or want to leave a situation, you can always type:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        home
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis will move you to your home, which initially is the River Bank.  In these caves, 
you can also type "back" to return to the previous lession chamber or "next" to go 
to the next one.  But try to do that only as a last resort.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTyping "help <command-name>" will show you on-line documentation, and typing just 
plain "help" will get you started.  Another important source of information is to 
ask other players questions.  Enjoy!
