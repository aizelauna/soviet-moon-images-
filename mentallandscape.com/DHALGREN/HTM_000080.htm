&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMidway across the bridge, a few abandoned cars and trucks litter the otherwise empty lanes.  It's raining, and a gust of strong wind blows through the girders, parting your hair.  Beyond, the burning city squats on glittering inverted reflections of its fires.  You sniff the air to catch a scent of burning.  To the east is the city, a place of inner discordances and retinal distortions.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beyond the bridge's pavement, you see the western bank of the river.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000011.htm">River bank</A>.
You walk west, off the deserted bridge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bellona appears closer now.  You can see the windows of its buildings; many are broken.

You walk east into the wounded city.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ jump ] <A HREF="HTM_000132.htm">The River</A>.
You jump off the side of the bridge and plummet into the river.  Splash!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look over the railing at the river, far below.  You notice a rusty ladder extending down the side of the pier.

You clamber over the railing and start down the ladder.  It is long and you have to rest several times before reaching the bottom.
