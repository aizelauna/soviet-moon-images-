&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Thought Transformation in Eight Stanzas
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [Kadampa teachings as translated by Brian Beresford.]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Being determined to accomplish
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   the highest welfare for all beings,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   who excel the wish-fulfilling gem,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   I shall constantly hold them dear.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   When in the company of another
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   I shall view myself as the lowest of all
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and in the depth of my heart
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   shall hold others dearly, as supreme.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Examining my mental continuum throughout all actions,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   as soon as a mental affliction arises,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   endangering myself and others,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   by facing it I shall stricly avert it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   When faced by a being of wicked nature
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   who is controlled by violent wrongs and sufferings,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   I shall hold this one dear, so hard to find
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   as though discovering a precious treasure.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   When others, out of jealousy,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   treat me badly, with abuse, insults and the like,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   I shall accept their hard words
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and offer the victory to others.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   When someone whom I have assisted
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and in whom I have placed great hope
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   inflicts on me extremely bad harm,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   I shall view that one as my supreme friend.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   In short, I shall offer benefit and bliss to all mothers
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   in this actual (life) and in the (future) continuum,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and secretly I shall take upon myself
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   all of the harms and sufferings of my mothers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Furthermore, having not defiled all this by the stain
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   of preconception of the eighty (worldly) feelings
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and by perceiving all phenomena as illusory,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   free from attachment, I shall be released from bondage.
