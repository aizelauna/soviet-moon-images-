After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... Willfulness ...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[Willfulness pauses]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... sits in a chair
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... looks just like you
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... but stark, tense, almost hunched,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... looking with a stare
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... as if in front of eir eyes
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[Willfulness pauses]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... were two sets of closed double doors,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... of iron or steel,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... in the darkness,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... maybe light behind,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... and e doesn't have the power
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[Willfulness pauses]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... to open the doors
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... but cannot wait for anyone's help
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... (must do it eirself)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... but cannot open them either
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp ... at least by any method yet tried.
