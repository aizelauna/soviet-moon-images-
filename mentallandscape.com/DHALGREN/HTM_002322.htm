<H3> Confession Booth (#2322)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000538.htm">Eclipse</A>)

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a small room, barely big enough to fit two standing people.  The only illumination here is from the light that creeps in around the edges of the curtain in the doorway.  A small, brown padded bench faces the doorway.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wood paneling on the walls, ceiling, and floor seem to absorb the light.  To your right, dim light is visible through the small, black iron grate set into the wall.  A quick look beyond it reveals nothing more than an identical chamber on the other side of the wall, most likely for the clergy to occupy.
<BR>
<BR>
You quietly sit down on the small bench.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001014.htm">Sister Devi</A> here.

EXITS:

You pull aside the heavy drapery and leave the booth.
