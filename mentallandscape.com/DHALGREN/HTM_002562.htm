&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEver since a piece of the moon fell into her eyes she's kept them on the ground.  She painted her boots silver so she'd have something to look at.  Her skin flows like honey over hungry bones and her fingers are always flexing.  There's a ragged smile across her cheekbone from a past death and she ties her hair out of her face with a frayed black ribbon.
