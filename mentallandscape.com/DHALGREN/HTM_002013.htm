Easter Parade, by The Blue Nile, starts playing on Tunes
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe wild is calling.... this time, I'll follow...  Easter Parade...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspearly morning... typewriters quiet... confetti falls from every window...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA city perfect ... in every detail...  Easter Parade...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI know you; birthday cards and silent music; paperbacks and Sunday clothes...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcrowd of people everywhere...  and then the people... are running forward...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEaster Parade...  Easter Parade.
