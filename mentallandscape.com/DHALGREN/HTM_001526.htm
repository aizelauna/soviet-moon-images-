&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself in a cramped room. Light spills down from a naked lightbulb about 8 feet above you. Shelves holding dust, old rags, a few empty boxes, a spare lightbulb and not much else line the back wall from floor to ceiling. A family of mice has made a home of the third shelf.  A small cot, rusty and sans mattress, has been folded and leaned up against the shelves. A broken water heater is to the left of the shelves, and a dusty full-length mirror is to the right.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a plain wooden door whose once bright blue paint is now cracked and faded with age.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001515.htm">Tiny Alcove</A>.
Feeling somewhat claustrophobic you go back into the alcove, which although it is small, offers a bit more space for movement. You close the closet door on your way out.
