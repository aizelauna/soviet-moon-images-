&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of those fat little buddhas, sitting with a big smile on his face. Or maybe it's only a little votive statue of Bodhidharma.
<BR>
<BR>
Ho-Tei has some things to say:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Some days we feel like strangers. When our heart opens, we will realize that we just belong here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When you meditate, sit with the dignity of a king or queen; when you move through your day, remain centered in this dignity.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A day spent judging another is a painful day. A day spent judging yourself is a painful day. You don't have to believe your judgments; they're simply an old habit.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't keep searching for the truth, just let go of your opinions.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Learn to respond, not react.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An upright posture and a few relaxed breaths can make a great difference.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Just as a snake sheds its skin, we should shed our past over and over again.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is not our preferences that cause problems, but our attachment to them.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Good-humored patience is necessary with mischievous children and your own mind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through our senses the world appears. Through our reactions we create delusions. Without reactions the world becomes clear.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Victory creates hatred, defeat creates suffering. Those who are wise strive for neither victory nor defeat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Even in conflict there is another way. Imagine if you were the Buddha, how do you solve it? (P.s. Who else should the Buddha be?)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Everything that has a beginning has an ending. Make your peace with that, and all will be well.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp When asked, 'Are you a god or a man?' the Buddha replied, 'I am awake.'
