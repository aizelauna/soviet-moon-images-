&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOzymandias stands proudly before you, his commanding eyes returning your stare, the expression on his face one of bemusement.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe evaluates you carefully as he decides whether you please or annoy him; then  a smile plays about his lips as he decides not to have you thrown to the jackyls.
