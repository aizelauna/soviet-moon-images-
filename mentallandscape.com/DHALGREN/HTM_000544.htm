&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChipped marble steps rise from the flat rock towards a set of grand doors. Piles of old dead leaves fill the nooks and crannies. To either side of this stairway, the darkened stones of the building rise majestically. Around the doors of iron are flaking carvings of entwined dragons and withered vines.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp These dark doors look to be made of weather-darkened iron. Large iron handles are flaked with rust and are surrounded by worked filigree. They are massive and forbidding.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the south is a section of flat rock, leveled with cement in places. Beyond you can see bits of greenery.
