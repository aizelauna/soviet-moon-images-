<H3> Tattoo Chamber (#2128)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000538.htm">Eclipse</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnly a single, bright lamp in the center of the room drives the darkness into the corners.  You cannot see into the corners, and the walls appear black and devoid of any decoration.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnder the gleam of the lamp, you see a bright metal cart upon which various antiseptics, swabs, needles, and inks are stashed.
<BR>
<BR>
You cautiously lay down on the leather couch, feeling a little anxious.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002088.htm">Biker Bob</A> and <A HREF="HTM_002203.htm">sign</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A large, heavy-looking, plain steel door, markedly the only exit from this room.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_002130.htm">Tattoo Den (waiting room)</A>.
With a sigh of relief, you open the door and leave, feeling a little dizzy and unsteady from your experience.
