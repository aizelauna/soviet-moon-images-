<H3> Tower Chamber (#998)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000538.htm">Eclipse</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis cold stone room offers little protection from the elements, with wide stone archways from wall to wall on every side.  Some archways have been meagerly covered with bits of cloth and newspaper, hopelessly tacked up as a protection from the wind and rain.  Empty tin cans, bottles, and food wrappers are the only signs of inhabitation here.
<BR>
<BR>
You lay down on the not-so-soft pallet.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002598.htm">Millebornes Game</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000539.htm">Sick</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Looking up through the hatch, you find yourself staring at the inside of a huge bell.
[ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000992.htm">Bell Tower</A>.
You take hold of the rope, and inch your way up into the darkness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Where a corner of a window remains uncovered, you can see the city skyline beyond the bell tower.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000991.htm">Tower Chamber (window ledge)</A>.
You dangerously step over the wall to the east, looking for a better view.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Looking down the stairs to the landing far below you makes you dizzy.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_000417.htm">Stair Landing</A>.
You carefully make your way down the stairs, holding tightly onto the splintered railing.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cloth and papers covering the window rustle as a breeze rushes through the room.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the noise of street gangs and car horns, far below.
