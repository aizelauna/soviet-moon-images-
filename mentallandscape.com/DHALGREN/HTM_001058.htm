<H3> Under a Tree (#1058)</H3>

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere under the boughs of a gnarled old persimmon tree is spread a large blanket. Three old guys are sitting being poets at a picnic, well supplied with wine and little bean cakes.
<BR>
<BR>
You find a nice spot on the blanket, near the tidbits.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Basho has a proud warrior's bearing, but is dressed in old, patched clothing. He's famous, but doesn't seem to mind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Kyokusui is a staunch, honorable warrior, two swords stuck prominently in his belt. He scowls.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Chinseki is a doctor. He looks at you inquisitively, not without humor. He offers you a bean cake; he seems to think you'll like it.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beyond the tree, the wide forest.
[ wood ] <A HREF="HTM_001369.htm">a Forest</A>.
You head out into the woodsraining
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho offers you and the others some wine from a jug.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe poets look like they're about to start up on something.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the poets whispers to you that they're going to do a 'renga', a poem in turns...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "Under a tree both soup and fish salad are covered with cherry blossoms."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "the westerly sun peaceful, it's fine weather--"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "a traveler passes scratching louse bites as spring ends."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "He hasn't learned how to sport a sword with sheathcover properly."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "come the bright moon, promotions are made at the temporary palace."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "the wood-cutter made a rice-huller swiftly..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "to the saddled three-year-old horse the autumn has come."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "the rain changes its name in various ways."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "men and women bathe in a Suwa hot spring as evening grows dark."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "among them a tall exorcist--"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "pushing an argument off to one side--"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "from a tenuous point her love has grown intense."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "when lost in thought, she's prodded to eat."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "looking at the moon, her face--sleeves laden with dew."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "on a boat in an autumn wind she's scared of the sound of waves."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "geese fly away toward Shiroko, Wakamatsu."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "a thousand scrolls recited at Ishinden under blossoms in their prime."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "a pilgrim died on the road where heat haze rises."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "above all a butterfly in reality stirs pity!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "not enough strength even to write a letter!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "with a silk gauze a noble figure avoids the sun."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "he weeps, insisting, 'I'd like to see Kumano'."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "at Ki the barrier guard with a short bow is obstinate."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "his bald head must be due to excessive drinking."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "so dark now the dots on the dice are peered at."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "facing his temporary altar he says prayers--"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "'Say what you will, I sit on the earth floor and suffer no fleas!'"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "'I am, in this village, a butt of derision.'"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "he's hated for being a busybody over the dance festival."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "night after moonlit night, the moon until dawn..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "the pampas grass, having beckoned for too long, is now withered."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "his is simply a square grass hut with dew."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "'I've sent back the money, saying "That's bothersome"'."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBasho says, "the decision is not to take the doctor's drugs."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChinseki says, "when blossoms come into bloom he runs about places like Yoshino."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKyokusui says, "getting bitten by gadflies in springtime mountains..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe poets have nothing more to say.
