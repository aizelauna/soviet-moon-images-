<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLeft over from the days of the left hemisphere's colonial domination of the right, 
the pastry case is wood, ornately carved. Its glass is cracked in a pattern like 
a spider's web.  Inside you see chocolate truffles, tiramisu, tartes, and cassatta 
alla Siciliana, all made from the finest ingredients available on the black market.
