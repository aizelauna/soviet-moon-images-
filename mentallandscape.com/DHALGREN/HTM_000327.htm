I'm hereby requesting an increase to 50K in order to develop a Valis-esque area of Bellona.  I'm trying to keep it within theme, by having be a neighborhood of Bellona, but naming the streets after characters in the Valis books and tying it all together with a few flashes of pink light, hallucinations of ancient Rome, etc.

Subj: an abject plea for quota
<BR>

<BR>
Just when it looks like the tattoo parlor idea might be going somewhere, thanks to the new generic dispenser, I discover that I'm over quota.  So, um, can I have some more?  In case one's memory needs to be refreshed, I'm planning on building a tattoo/piercing parlor in The Pit (#1387), the presently-undescribed basement of Le Cafe' Fetish (#1310).  So.  Hope this is official enough.
<BR>

<BR>
Oh yeah.  Please?

I looked over her building. I like how she does stuff. Admittedly, there is little programming, but I think there will be more forthcoming. I only increased her by 25k. To 100k total.

Subj: a quota request for Eclipse
<BR>

<BR>
well, i didn't think i'd get this far, but here i am, asking for quota.  i'm requesting 50k in order to flesh out the public building i've done; all of my original 50k has gone into public building (other than myself, weighing in at 4.4k, and a $thing with a :tell verb that helps me work on $exit messages).  i think the public building i've done is worthwhile, and i'd like to do more.
<BR>
my first project is a child of the generic wandering automaton.  i've called it the generic wandering speaking automaton (gswa for short, #1044), because (obviously) it speaks.  it's speak_msg property holds any number of strings, and responds with a random one when the command 'talk to <bot name>' is used.  owners can also choose the way the gswa responds, since i've made a says_message property that allows the owner to make the gswa scream, mutter, giggle, etc.  of course, these can be randomized as well.  the gswa has 3 kids; one currently works in a bar, another is a mad guru who dispenses surreal bits of wisdom, and the other doesn't seem to have been programmed yet.
<BR>
my other major public work has been the office building, southwest from legba's 'The Crossroads' (#113).  currently the building is somewhat vacant; i live on the top (seventh) floor along with sick.  the floor below is 'devi's temple', which houses my gswa guru.  i hope that she will be a bigger attraction when i have more residents and services to offer in the building.  the fourth floor is my storage area of sorts; i store the gswa here, and plan to keep other generics and the like here.  floors two, three, and five are empty, although i may be adding residents soon.  i also have an alternative to having residents on these empty floors; i plan on working on a tattoo/piercing parlour, and the idea of an art gallery has been suggested.  i might take the art gallery idea and run with it, making it a gallery/coffee house, complete with poets, hippies, and the like.
<BR>
i do have one contibuting resident in the building; soma is currently building a stairwell off the lobby, that will eventually lead to a basement.  she has mentioned that she is considering building a network of tunnels from the basement.  i am currently helping her with @messages and suggestions about building.  neschek's home ('under the rock') is currently in my workroom, and i'm trying to convince him to come up with a few ideas we could work on together.
<BR>
i invite you to come to the office building any time and wander about.  all exits are described, and while there may not be too much to see right now, i think it's a good start.  i have tried to remain in theme with my building, and it is publicly connected.
<BR>
i hope you'll think, as i do, that i've put my first 50k to good use, and that you will see fit to grant me more.  i would be happy to hear suggestions and comments, and if you feel this area isn't worth the quota, i'm willing to start fresh.
<BR>
thanx for your time (and patience in reading this long long request),
<BR>

Subj: Quota (what else?)
<BR>

<BR>
I have created some cool scenery, a fully functional gargoyle, and a somewhat crudely hacked but working boat. I have a variety of ideas kicking around, definitely an expansion of my area, but also a generic jukebox, a "square" bot (who wandered in from Diversity University), a literary drug dealer ...  The Solitude will extend toward my compound -- a post-industrial park with homebase bunker, factory, and motor speedway.

<BR>
Alas, though I have endeavored to make my large 3 x 3 wasteland (Dog Solitude) as economical of kilobytes as possible by parenting rooms and exits, the large number of the latter has pushed me over the (apparently) 60-object limit.  I would like some more objects so that I can pursue my dream of wide open spaces  -- up to 100 perhaps?

Yipes! That last update hit hard.
<BR>
 I've pretty much completed my area ... just need to add 1 more room as a personal hangout. Near-future efforts will concentrate on spiffing up existing areas, and possibly building a couple of interesting bots.

Hi!  Here is Yet Another Request For More Quota!  I noticed that I have
<BR>
actually blown my quota by a K or so, so I figured it was time to
<BR>
officialy ask for some more...
<BR>
If you would, please ponder some of what I have constructed so far.
<BR>
Most notably, I've created the skeleton of a three story building for
<BR>
the purpose of testing a new generic I've written -- a Generic Elevator
<BR>
and the associated Generic Elevator Call Button.  Feel free to test
<BR>
them out some over near the Ministry of Information (#1493).
<BR>
Although I'm willing to write up a description of the elevator generic,
<BR>
I'm not sure how to (yet) or if it counts against my quota...
<BR>
One interesting feature to note about the elevator generic is that
<BR>
it allows for both a "reliable" and an "unreliable" mode.  In unreliable
<BR>
mode, there is a 1 in <odds> chance that the elevator doesn't make it
<BR>
to the next floor!  BTW, I haven't had the chance to test it very heavily
<BR>
in a multi-player scenario to make sure that it behaves correctly with
<BR>
respect to announcing behaviour to all interesting parties in the various
<BR>
rooms.  I *think* it does, but I have yet to verify this.  One small bug
<BR>
I know about -- I need to modify the "look" mechanism to allow one to
<BR>
see the control panel again.  Currently it is only visible once upon
<BR>
entry into the elevator.
<BR>
Let me know what you think so far!  And, don't be afraid to kick it if
<BR>
acts strangely!
<BR>

<BR>
Thanks,
<BR>
Gaijin

I found on the www a tutorial for Moo (lambda moo). I started

working on it, but when I was about to make my first program, I was
<BR>
told I first needed to be a programmer. How can I become one?

Subj: Your request
<BR>

<BR>
It's a good idea, but it needs more work.  Currently, your elevator doesn't seem to go anywhere, and you have a lot of undescribed objects and exits.  At least flesh out these things first.

Subj: I dunno if I need to ask right now, but...
<BR>

<BR>
I am building rooms based mostly on generics, but fleshing them out as much as possible.  I think my quota is about 2/3 full and growing and I would like to respectfully ask for some more, though don't award it if you think it's too soon.
<BR>

<BR>
The room I've almost totally completed is #1499, off of the House of Freaks.  I'll probably expand that way a little and then begin building somewhere else entirely different.
<BR>

<BR>
I can't figure out how to get @quota to tell me the size of my objects.

Subj: Request for more quota
<BR>

<BR>
I'd like more quota to increase the interactivity of my bot Kim, make my gas can and plastic sign into fully help-commented generics, and improve my Generic Room with Surfaces.  
<BR>

<BR>
In defense of this request on what is admittedly a tight server, may I point out the quality, themeliness, and interactivity of my existing areas and objects. I have tried wherever possible to turn my ideas into usable, customizable generics (such as my jukebox and Room with Surfaces) with adequate help-messaging. Some extra quota would help me continue in this vein.  
<BR>

Subj: Interzonal Edge Request
<BR>

<BR>
Steelgrave and I have finished a joint project, Morte Deliziozo (#584) with its refreshments and "owner", Mama Hunch (#997).  Morte is now open to the public and we've used up our quota, but there are a few more touches we would like to make (Mama will become a GSWA with #1044's capabilities fully developed and a few more added, a mugwump will buttonhole people in a back alley, offering a certain unspecified but precious substance).  But our real interest is in making a gambling & drug den.  Watching how people on various MOOs have played with creating a hallucinatory unreality within the fantasy reality of MOO has interested us, and we'd like to try something a bit different.  I'm only a beginning programmer, and Steelgrave even more so, but we have some conceptual innovations in mind.  Out planned projects have this theme: to play with the boundaries between "reality" and "illusion" within the context of MOO.  The virtual physicality of MOO gives rise to a "reality" here, and also its opposite, MOO illusion and fantasy.  Defining and exploring these layers of illusion within illusion fascinates us.  We want to build things that speak to the virtual senses, sometimes fooling them.  In a slight way, you'll see this in the interaction of players and desserts in Morte ("taking" them so you have them while you eat them but so does someone else eating the same dessert, because no one really does).  This is our try at answering problem of the limitations of bar-type drink verbs (like :order on Mama) vs. the less-than-interesting interaction with edibles made from recyclables.  Our 4 desserts aren't the ultimate solution by any means, and we'd like to pursue this further.
<BR>

<BR>
Steelgrave and I both request more quota, since we put equal efforts into Morte and will be partners on future projects.  If you have any questions or suggestions, we'll be glad to respond.
