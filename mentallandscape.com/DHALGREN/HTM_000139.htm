&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe walls of the store still have neon signs and large, bright ads on them.  There are groceries here too: cans of tuna and soup and fruit cocktail and spaghetti-os, rice and cereal and jars of ketchup and mayonnaise.  Sometimes there's fresh food as well: milk, eggs, cheese, fruits and vegetables bartered from the farmers downriver, kept in a generator-fueled cooler on the far wall.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStill, it's not quite like grocery stores used to be.  The only light comes from dozens of flickering candles, scattering moving shadows on the yellowing walls.  The scent is cheese and apples, dry cereal and dust, and below that a sweet burning that might be sage.

You make your way up the narrow, wooden stairs.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ out ] <A HREF="HTM_000128.htm">Outside the Grocery Store</A>.
You struggle to raise the heavy, rolldown security door.  It clearly hasn't been oiled in quite sometime.  You manage to raise it up just enough to squirm under it, and fortunately, think to let it down gently so it doesn't bang and break a window or something.
