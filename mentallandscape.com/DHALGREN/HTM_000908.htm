&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTall and lanky, ichor runs through her veins. She can leap tall stone walls and claims kinship with a certain british spy --the one who died ignominiously in russia.  She is wearing dark green coveralls, rather grease stained, with a patch on the front pocket saying: "Callipygian --I love you". Remind her to wash her hands. A gibbous moon hangs from her left ear.
