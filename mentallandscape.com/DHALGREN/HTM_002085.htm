&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLynx is a sleek, svelte length of luxurious amber-gold fur who regards you warmly 
through soulful blue eyes. His cutely tufted ears focus attentively at the slightest 
whisper, his long tail swishes slowly in the breeze, and he pads along silently on 
Velvet Paws of Doom (tm). Lynx's status is: Friendly.
