&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne hundred stories above street level, you are standing in the top-floor office of Bellona's mayor.  It is a vast, high-ceilinged room containing a desk and conference table, both of redwood.  Through tall windows all around, you see the tops of a few tall buildings emerging from a blanket of haze.  The sky is a featureless blue with a reddish sun that seems much too large..

You see <A HREF="HTM_000426.htm">Player Request Board</A>, <A HREF="HTM_000508.htm">WhoIsWho</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000002.htm">The_Mayor</A> here.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ elevator ] <A HREF="HTM_000183.htm">Lobby Of Office Building</A>.
You get in the elevator and the door closes.  It begins to descend so fast you wonder if the cables have broken!  Finally it stops at the ground floor and you gladly step out.
