&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGeneric Flammable Object is intended for use with Trism's Gasoline Can. It
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcontains no verbs itself, but has useful properties that will help you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcustom-create bonfires, effigies, and even custom-engineer your own fiery
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"suicide."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
