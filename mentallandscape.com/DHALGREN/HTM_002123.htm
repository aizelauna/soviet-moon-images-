&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou're certain that if there were inspectors left here, this place would be condemned and knocked down in a second.  Parts of these stairs look like lace, and it's hard to believe you're even standing steadily where you are, midway between the entrance and the black door above you.  A dayglo green sign hangs from the doorknob above you.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look down and stifle a yelp as you realize your feet aren't actually touching the rotted wood below them.  It looks like your feet are resting comfortably on an invisible support just a few millimeters above the stair step.  You must be imagining it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The black-painted wood of this black-lit stairway looks brittle and weak.  It's hard to believe your feet are actually supported by the stairs.  You feel like it's entirely possible that you could just fall through without any warning at all.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The walls are covered with dayglo felt art which all glow ghostily under the black light shining from no specific source in this place.  One particularly striking poster shows the Cheshire Cat leering at you.  At odd moments, you seem to see the entire cat, and at others, just the grin.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The door above you is painted with a thick coat of black enamel paint, which reflects a black-light sheen at you.  There are three brass numbers attached, which you read as 669, until you realize that the last 9 is a dangling number 6.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The dayglo green background draws your eyes in to read the black lettering, which says, in shaky hand, SINNERS ENTER.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_002119.htm">Battle Zone</A>.
You're utterly grateful that you didn't fall through the stairs, and you sigh as you push your way through the doors to the street again.
