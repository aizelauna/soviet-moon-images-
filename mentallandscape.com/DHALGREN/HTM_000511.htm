&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe moves quickly, with indifferent efficiency and seemingly everywhere at once, mixing drinks and pulling pints of beer from the shiny taps. She doesn't say much while she works, but regards you, if you manage to catch her attention at all, with a half amused stare. Her black brows arch sharply in the center and meet just above her slightly hooked nose, making a darkness like crow's wings across her face. Her lips are full and a rich shade of dark violet, with small creases beginning in the corners. Her blue-black hair she crops herself, close to the scalp with small scissors.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp She wears a black leather bra that fastens up the front with a brass zipper, tight black jeans and black boots that lace up to just under her knees.  On the tanned and sinewy bicep of her right arm she has a monochrome tattoo of a calla lily.
