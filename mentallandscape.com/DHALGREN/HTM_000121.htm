&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe floor is layered with bright, Persian rugs of various patterns, looted from Bellona's once fine department stores. Hanging from the wall are masks, some from other places, some homemade; the skulls of several mammals, and one or two original Klee prints borrowed from the art museum. Bits of bright cellophane have been taped to the window by way of stained glass.

This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cat claws plaintively at the door, begging for breakfast.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA lonely train whistle howls in the distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tree branch scratches eerily at the window, looking for a way in.
