&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a wheel suspended by its axle between two columns.  On the right Hermanubis, the Spirit of God, strives to climb to the top of the wheel.  On the left Typhon, the Spriit of Evil, is cast down.  The Sphinx balanced on the top of this wheel, holds a sword in its lion's paw.  It personifies Destiny ever ready to strike left or right; according to the direction in which it turns the wheel the humblest rises and the highest is cast down.
