&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA deep, crumble-edged trench, its banks half-overgrown with mullein, poison ivy, dandelion. Its bottom is mostly covered with an ankle-deep mire of water, clay, and yellow-green algae. Here and there a good-sized piece of shale juts out of the water; you just might be able to pick your way across without getting your feet wet. To the east, you hear a dull buzz of voices, although you can't quite see over the tangle of dead willows and chokecherries on the bank.
