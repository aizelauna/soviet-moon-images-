&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA shabby coffeehouse, once genteel. You smell French roast coffee brewing and the residue of too many clove cigarettes. Against the right wall, toward the front windows, is a counter where you might order some coffee, if you're that desperate. Looking around the dark room, you see a bookshelf overflowing with old magazines, a towering brick fireplace flanked by what look like church pews and scattered places to sit, including a maroon couch, various cafe tables and chairs, and a blue Barcalounger. The tangle of pipes and keyboards in the left rear corner might once have been an organ.

You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A mahogany counter with a large espresso machine, a neatly arranged pile of stale croisants, and a tarnished silver sugar bowl and creamer. Looking carefully, you see the initials C-M W engraved upon them. Unfortunately, no one seems to be working here yet, so you'll have to help yourself.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An apparently random collection of old periodicals. Leafing through, you notice two years worth of _Popular Mechanics_ from 1965-67, several issues of the _International Herald Tribune_, a single copy of _Godey's Ladies'Book_ from 1855, random issues of _Boy's Life_, and a dogeared, heavily annotated copy of _Pre/Text_. The only books are _Ulysses_ and _Standing Firm_.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The brick fireplace looms agains the back wall, both comforting and vaguely sinster. The mantle holds two large brass candlesticks and a bowl of cat food. Decorative tiles depicting the signs of the Zodiac surround the hearth. The fire within emits little heat and less light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A ramshackle contraption of pipes and wires and hoses. On closer inspection, it does look as it if might be playable, with a little more work.
