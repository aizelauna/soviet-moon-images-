&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cantilevered roof arches over a vast arena, still the scene of rare public gatherings to see movies or performance art.  The polished wooden floor is decorated with the lines and arcs of a basketball court, but also with several stenciled outlines of human bodies.  It is unclear whether the police painted them or some street-art activists.
