&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe narrow street to the west opens up into a wider stretch of asphalt which you are certain was once a street.  To the north and south are debris strewn clearings which could have been buildings at one time.  Some of the fragments look like they just fell down while others show signs of violent trauma like explosions and similar rendings.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the middle of this street is a scorched wreck, which looks very like a superposition of a lamppost, a dumpster and a tanker truck.  The twisted mass brings to mind post-armageddon science fiction films, and amazingly, the pile is still burning, giving off an unholy red and orange light which flickers through the rubble in the clearings on either side of it.

You edge east, curious about the run-down house.  As you get close, the wreck rumbles and propels a small fiery explosion at you, pushing you through the door before you're quite ready.  At least you're not toast.
