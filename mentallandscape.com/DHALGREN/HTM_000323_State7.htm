<H3>Jeremy (#323): helpless</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA punk in his late teens, arms bound behind his back, spiky blond hair, a handsome face flashing with anger and defiance now.  He's wearing jeans and a ribbed cotton tank top.  His arms look strong, and in his present hostile mood, its probably a good thing they are not free to punch your face.
