&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is absolutly no light to be had in this section of tunnel at all. The current isn't very strong, but you can tell that it flows in the direction that you are currently thinking is north, but without any kind of landmarks it is impossible to tell. There are tunnels branching off at all times, some flowing out of this one, some into it. The smell of the road gets more and more faint as you go further downstream, and the smell of stagnant sewage gets much stronger. You are currently walking on a shelf that allows you to stay out of the actual sewage. There is a slight breeze blowing, east?.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The slight breeze is blowing down this tunnel. The current isn't flowing at all this way.
[ East ] <A HREF="HTM_002529.htm">Sewer</A>.
The shelf is slightly bumpy and you wouldn't want to fall into the sewage, or would you?
