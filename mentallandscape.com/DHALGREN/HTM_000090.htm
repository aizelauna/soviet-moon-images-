<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA wet concrete path runs east and west through a peaceful and startlingly beautiful orchard of nutmeg trees.  A canopy of leaves arches over several benches of cedarwood.  The trees are laden with sweet yellow nutmeg fruit, and some green monkeys play in the upper branches.  Through a break in the haze, you see a strangely enlarged red sun.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou notice a faded small sign by the path.  It reads, "Please do not feed, pet, annoy, harass or kick the animals."  A narrow path leads south.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_000093.htm">nutmeg fruit</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000197.htm">the monkey</A> here.
