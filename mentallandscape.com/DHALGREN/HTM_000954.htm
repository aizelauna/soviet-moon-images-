&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe stray cat is now frightened and hissing...it stares at you with its back up...its tail looking something like a scrub brush with no bristles.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000954_State1.htm">kick</A> ] kicks the mangy cat. It hisses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000954_State3.htm">pet</A> ] pets the mangy cat. Startled, it shies away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000954_State2.htm">feed</A> ] picks up a fragment of a candied apple from the ground and feeds it to the mangy cat. The cat licks it tentatively and then grabs it greedily.
