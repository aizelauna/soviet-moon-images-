&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see stalls.  The grate over a drain in the middle of the floor chatters when you step on it.  In the sink, a trickle spills the porcelain, crawls like a glass worm through the light lozenges from the window high in the concrete.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002201.htm">Right Stall</A> and <A HREF="HTM_001378.htm">Left Stall</A> here.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ south ] <A HREF="HTM_000180.htm">Clearing In The Park</A>.
You push open the door and leave.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ down ] <A HREF="HTM_000338.htm">Damp Tunnel</A>.
You pull the rusty grating out of the way and gently lower yourself down into darkness.
