<H3>Holy Mother (#2069): awake</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is the glowing, radiant goddess of Love, Fertility and Sexuality, as resurrected from the Judeo-Christian mythology.  She is awake and alert, bathed in her own radiance of beauty and power, stunning, naked, sitting quietly on an old, worn out cot here in her Son's house.  Her halo sparkles, almost like new plastic.  You are entranced.  Around her, on the floor lay some of her worshippers.  They're clearly worn out for today.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002069_State3.htm">kiss</A> ]'s attentions don't seem to soothe Mary now, who stops her, asking her why she does this and who she thinks Mary is? "There's a time and a place for that, my Child."

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002069_State4.htm">worship</A> ] finds comfort in worshipping The Holy Mother. Her radiance intensifies (if that were possible) and she smiles more broadly. The sense of love fills the room.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_002069_State4.htm">talk</A> ] leans close and talks quietly with Holy Mary, Mother of God, whose radiance only intensifies, and her smile hypnotizes her. She pats the cot beside her, indicating that she should sit.
