&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a woman seated on a throne wearing a crown armed with spear-points: she holds in her righthand an upward-pointing word and in the left a pair of scales.  It is the ancient symbol of Justice weighing inthe balance of the deeds of men, and as a counter-weight opposing evil with the sword of expiation.  Justice, which proceeds from God, is the stabilising reaction which restores order, equilibrium between rigth and duty.  The sword is here a sign of protection for the righteous and of warning for the sinful.  The eyes of Justice are covered with a bandage to show that she weighs and strikes without taking into account the conventional differences established by me.
