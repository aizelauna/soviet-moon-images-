&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself standing on a small concrete landing. A dim bulb hanging from the ceiling sways back and forth in a non-existent breeze, casting an eerie glow on the metal steps before you. Shadows dance rhythmically on the walls and ceiling.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a heavy, darkly stained oak door. There are a few scratches and splatters of paint etched on its surface, and when it opens or closes it creaks on its hinges. Perhaps it could use a good oiling.

You twist the doorknob and pull on the door with all your might. When it doesn't open, you try pushing it. It creaks on its hinges, but opens. Feeling a bit foolish, you glance around, making sure nobody saw you and walk through the doorway.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a steep metal staircase that appears to lead into total blackness.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_001006.htm">The Basement</A>.
You hesitate at the top step, peering anxiously down into complete blackness. Walking cautiously down the creaking steps, you use your hand to guide your way, feeling along the wall for a light switch.
