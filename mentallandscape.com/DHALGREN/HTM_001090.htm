&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA single oil lamp hangs from a hook here, illuminating this end of a narrow hallway leading south. The floor is covered in carpeting, showing bright blood red patterns swirling intricately, making you dizzy after staring at them for too long. The walls are still stone, but sparkle in the lamplight as if glistening, though no dampness is in the air.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A broad stairway, leading down. The marble steps can be seen beyond the edges of the bright plush carpeting that covers the center and meshes with the carpet here.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_001085.htm">Hall</A>.
You start down the staircase and reach the bottom quickly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hallway leads south into dimness.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001094.htm">Narrow Hallway</A>.
You follow the hallway south with great trepidation.
