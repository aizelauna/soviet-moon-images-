&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you're new to this MUD, you should probably start out by going back out, then 
northeast, and reading the reference room to the north from there. East from the 
library vestibule is the map room, which will tell you where you can explore. After 
you get acquainted with TinyMUD, you can then try making yourself a home!
