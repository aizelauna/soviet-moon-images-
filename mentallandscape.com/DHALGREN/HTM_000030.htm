(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000032.htm">Generic Help Database</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000038.htm">Hacker</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA help database (in the sense of anything that is usable by $player:help()) is any object having the following two verbs:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  :find_topics(string)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     returns a list of strings or some boolean false value.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  :get_topic(string)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     given one of the strings returned by :find_topics this either
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     returns a list of strings (text to be spewed to the player) or
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     returns 1 to indicate that it has already taken care of printing
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     information to the player.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp$player:help() consults any .help properties that exist on the player, its ancestors, player.location and its ancestors (in that order).  These properties are assumed to have values that are objects or lists of objects, each object itself assumed to be a help database in the above sense.  The main help database ($help) is placed at the end of the list of databases to be consulted.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Generic Help Database (this object) is the standard model help database of which the actual help database itself ($help) is an instance.  On help databases of this type, every help topic has a corresponding property, interpreted as follows:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.(topic) = string           - one-line help text.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.(topic) = {"*verb*",@args} - call this:verb(@args) to get text
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis.(topic) = any other list   - multi-line help text
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor the {"*verb*",...} form, the current verbs available are
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  {"*forward*", topic2, @rest}   
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     - get topic2 help text and then append rest.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       rest may, in turn, begin with a "*verb*"...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  {"*subst*", @lines} 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     - all occurences of [exp] in lines are replaced with value of exp.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       exp is assumed to evaluate to a string.  Evaluation is done using 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       $no_one's permissions so exp can only refer to public information.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  {"*index*"}
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     - returns a list of all topics in this database, arranged in columns.
<BR>
