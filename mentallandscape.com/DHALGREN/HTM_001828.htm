&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are advised to use an unlinked exit from the TransPort Designer's Teleport Room 
(south, west, north) to start building your area or home; after you're done, meet 
with a wizard or another builder to see about linking your area in consistently with 
the other areas. See the Map Room if you'd like to find good places to develope!
