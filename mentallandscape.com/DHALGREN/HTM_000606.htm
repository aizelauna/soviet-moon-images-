&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCrates and piles of heavy rope litter the wharf.  Sea water laps underneath, and a boat on the west side of the dock bumps against the wood.  The port is crowded on this dry warm day.  To the north, a narrow street winds its way into the heart of The City.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From the dock, a narrow street leads into the heart of Interzone
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_000422.htm">Interzone Plaza</A>.
You walk north through streets crowded with donkeys, camels, llamas, rickshaws, carts of merchandise.  From dark doorways, street hustlers watch with knowing eyes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beside the dock, some smugglers have moored their boat.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000609.htm">Bellona: Bus Depot</A>.
You step onto the boat and pay for passage. You feel sick and are starting to shiver as you pass out. When you awake, Interzone seems like a distant dream.
