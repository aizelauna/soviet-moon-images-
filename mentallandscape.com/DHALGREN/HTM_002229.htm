&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a generic dung beetle player, the supreme Dhalgren-themed class, who can integrate random psychosexual acts of God and do a few other tricks.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVix is a powerful magic-using hobbit who wears a voluminous black cape and a big black fedora which he pulls low over eyes that glow and smolder like red-hot coals.  In order to remain vaguely themely he wears old diodes and resistors braided into the glossy long hair on his feet.  As insurance, he mumbles bits from Kathy Acker novels under his breath.
