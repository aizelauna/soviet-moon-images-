&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA costume for the role of the Chorus in a classical tragedy. Buskins? Instruments? But no mask...

After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Chorus starts dancing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Chorus strums an instrument, singing...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            Long though may be the days,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            the one sole thing that brings them
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            together is the weight and feel and
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            sounds of this body. Always.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Chorus pauses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            Odd thing, that the human condition
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            should be one of triumphantly going
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            beyond the confines of the body, or
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            so we seem to like to think. Bodies
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Chorus pauses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            are what we are, when all is
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            said and done. Lengthen our days in
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            concentration rapt on what's beyond
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChorus:            and yet still remember this.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Chorus is finished.
