&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis part of the hallway looks much narrower than its counterpart on the other side. Hanging from a hook on the wall is another oil lamp, but this one is almost out of fuel. The flame is barely visible and wavers in near starvation. Consequently, flickering shadows dance upon the glistening chilled stone walls. You see things move out of the corner of your eyes. You aren't sure if this is any better than the complete darkness.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hallway continues north, where some more illumination can be seen.
