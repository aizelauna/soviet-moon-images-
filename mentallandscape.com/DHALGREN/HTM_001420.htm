&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEach Bone of the Body
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     sounds like a prayer, sacrum,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsternum, scapula, as if those
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    who first regarded, then named,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthem belonged to an ancient cult
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    of architects who built temples
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat resembled human forms with
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    limbs outstretched so that they
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfaced the stars like stars and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     offered back this planet's
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspelements as five spokes on a 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     spinning wheel.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf each bone of the body is holy
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     it is because it gives shape to 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmortal love--bowl of the pelvis
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     like a cradle, sickles of the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphips like two moons, every angle
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     open as the mouth to a kiss--
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspeven though we will all be torn.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     one day, from the comfort
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof our usual orbits, and broken.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYesterday, a woman I didn't
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     know unbuttoned her blouse
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspslowly, as on a long summer morning,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     held the violet silk slightly
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspapart like those statues of Christ
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     from my youth with his private
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsmile red as the hook and eye of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     a surgeon's needle, his crimson
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnimbus, cold fingers resting
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     against his quiet stone heart
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat was forever on fire, wounded,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     crowned with bloody thorns,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand worn like false regret or like
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     a ghastly pendant hung
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspat the precise center of his chest.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnce I believed
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     love was like that, a cruelty
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat haunted the empire of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     my childhood with the hushed
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspvoices of black-robed nuns
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     who spoke of Adam's ripped side,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphow God drove his fist in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     until that first man fell
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsilent, then snapped off a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     single rib that looked, at
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfirst, like the waxing moon until
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     he crushed it beneath his
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspheels like dust, mixed in blood
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     from the season's first kill,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthen gave it to the wind for form,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     to the man who called that
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspnew shape Eve, though she cared
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     little for his list of rules
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand names, preferred instead slender
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     throats of irises, pomegranates
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwith their skin of fire, orb of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     gold for morning, silver-black
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspat night, and the circular logic
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     of stars.  She was judged to be
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptoo much in love with the sleek
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     tongues of fallen angels, the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptaste of what was sweet and forbidden
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and sin.  What could she say
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspexcept that she loved the heft of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     her bones, the way her mouth
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphad wrapped around the promise of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     knowing all there was to know?
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn a room whose battered wooden
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     floor was always covered with
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthick curls of white wax and so
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     seemed in perpetual winter,
