<H3>brown goat (#1047): in heat</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA seriously horny goat, raising its engorged rear end.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">feed</A> ] feeds the goat. It forgets all about being horny.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State6.htm">pet</A> ] pets the goat. It bleats and exposes its rear to her.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State6.htm">milk</A> ] milks the brown goat, which makes a sound suspiciously like a moan.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State5.htm">kick</A> ] kicks the brown goat, which butts her and trots several steps away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State4.htm">ignore</A> ] ignores the brown goat despite its obvious need. The brown goat nuzzles her and bleats hopefully.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State6.htm">woo</A> ] continues to woo the goat, which bleats pitifully at her teasing.
