&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a woman seated at the centre of a blazing sun; she is crowned by twelve stars and her feet rest on the moon.  She is the personification of universal fecundity.  The sun is the emblem of creative strength; the crown of stars symbolises, by the number 12, the houses or stations through which the sun travels year after year.  This woman, celestial Isis or Nature, carries a sceptre surmounted by a globe: it is the sign of her perpetual activity over things born and unborn.  On her other hand she bears an eagle, symbol of the heights to which spirit may soar.  The moon beneath her feet signifies the weakness of matter and its domination by the Spirit.
