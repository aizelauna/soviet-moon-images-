<H3>brown goat (#1047): frisky</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dangerously playful-looking four-horned nanny goat.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">feed</A> ] feeds the goat, which happily snatches the food from her hand.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State4.htm">pet</A> ] pets the brown goat. It rubs against her in a friendly manner.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State5.htm">milk</A> ] milks the brown goat. It kicks her in the head....Tee hee! :)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State3.htm">kick</A> ] kicks the brown goat for no reason. It kicks her back, harder, and looks annoyed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047.htm">ignore</A> ] ignores the brown goat. It tries to engage her for a while, then does the goat equivalent of a shrug and nuzzles around for something to eat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State6.htm">woo</A> ] woos the goat. It turns its back to her, raises its tail, and bleats longingly.
