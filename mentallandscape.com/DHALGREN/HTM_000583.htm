&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLight and dark, these rich domes of chocolate promise a variety of opulent flavors.
<BR>
You inhale a dark, mysterious mingling of chocolates with a hint of liqueur.
<BR>
You sink your teeth into the chocolate, feel its small, satisfying crack, and its taste, sweet, followed by bitter, followed by sweet, melts on your tongue.
<BR>
The chocolate is cool and smooth.
<BR>
You pick out a truffle and bite into it, wondering what you'll find inside.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You bite into bittersweet chocolate and find its heart is a dark, tart-sweet morello cherry preserved whole in brandy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The white chocolate dome you have chosen holds a dark center.  Your teeth sink in smooth as butter.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You slowly suck at a dark chocolate shell until you reach its creamy white chocolate middle, flavored with framboise.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A lightning zigzag of dark chocolate decorates a milk chocolate dome.  You take a bite and feel the pleasant jolt of cappucino.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Powdered praline dusts the milk chocolate truffle you lift to your mouth.  Inside, chopped pecans add texture to the soft milk chocolate.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...In small nibbles you eat a Grand Marnier truffle.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You close your eyes and bite.  The melting warmth of dark bittersweet is cooled with Creme de Menthe.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You lick at a dark chocolate shell dipped in white.  Then you take the plunge...kahlua.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Your teeth crack the outer shell of the truffle you've picked.  The taste of chocolate mingles with the heady scent of rum.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Tart and bright, lemon cuts the sweetness of the truffle you choose.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You lift, not a truffle, but a whole huge, perfect, juicy ripe strawberry dipped in dark chocolate.  You dangle it by its green stem and bite.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You bite into bitter chocolate and discover moist coconut mingled with the sweetness of white chocolate.
