&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see roasted foie gras about the size of a large man's fist, sliced into quarter-inch slabs.  This goose liver was enlarged by force feeding, and probably amounted to a fourth of the weight of the unhappy bird before it was butchered.  It is marbled with hard fat and beige in color.  
<BR>
You smell the savory aroma of fatted goose liver.
<BR>
You eat a slice of the roasted foie gras.  It is incredibly rich, with a savory flavor of liver.  It literally melts like butter in your mouth.
