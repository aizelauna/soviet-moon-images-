&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see the image of the Hierophant (Master of the Sacred Mysteries).  This prince of occult doctrine is seated between the two columns of the sanctuary.  He is leaning on a cross with three horizontals and describes with his index finger of his right hand the sign of silence on his breast.  Athis feet two men have prostrated themselves, one clothed in red, the other in black.  The Hierophant represents the Genius of good intentions and the spirit of conscience; his gesture invites to meditation, to listen to the voice of the heavens in the silence of passions and of the instincts of the flesh.  The column on his right symbolises the divine law; the one on the left signifies freedom to obey or disobey.  The triple cross is the emblem of God pervading the three worlds in order to produce in them all the manifistations of life.  The two men, one red, the other black, represent the genii of Light and Darkness, both of whom obey the Master of the Arcana.
