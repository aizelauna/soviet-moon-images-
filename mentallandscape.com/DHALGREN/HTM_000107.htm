Subj: This list
<BR>

<BR>
This list is mainly going to be used to announce new creations and other important stuff that may not end up in the newspaper.
<BR>

<BR>
For instance, I have just begun a couple of PCs:
<BR>

<BR>
The Basic Local PC #98 is sandwiched in between $player and $builder much like Frand's PC on Lambda. We'll be adding local specific stuff to this class that everyone needs to have.
<BR>

<BR>
The Useful Utilitarian PC #99 is a child of $programmer and provides some useful programmer verbs. Anyone can become a child of this, but it's not mandatory or anything.
<BR>

<BR>
More on the way.

<BR>

<BR>
I have created the Featuress Feature #111. 
<BR>

<BR>
With this feature added and by typing @wf (@whatfeature) you will see a listing of what features exist and which of those you haven't added. It will also tell you which are ready for the public and which aren't. 
<BR>

<BR>
When you create a new feature, by using @fregister (on #111), your feature will be moved to #111 for safekeeping and be listed as ready for public use.
<BR>

<BR>
This should help keep track of all the features.

I skimmed the first 100 page of Dahlgren.  The north-south street you hit off the bridge is Broadway and extends into the city.  Near the park (the crossroads?) is a sorta gay bar called "Teddy's", which featured a male cage dancer in the book (wearing a silver G-string).  Just what legba was about to build!
<BR>
 Continuing north, Is Jackson avenue, suburban homes, and then Brisbain avenue and "The Heights" where the newspaper owner has a large walled estate.  I think I will change "Mayor" to "RogerCalkins" who seems to be the unseen force in Dhalgren (the newspaper owner).

How about making an option? Maybe someone likes the default messages, or maybe they want to set their own? I dunno. It's a suggestion to think about.

I've made a modification to the Generic Ambient Noise room #176.

I noticed that the tasks continued to run when people logged out in there. Since the room was technically occupied by a player.

Several people have asked about places to build.  Check out the rough map (#406).  Folks could build urban warehouse/storefront stuff by the loading dock.  Labry Apartments can be taken over (I only built the lobby).  Wanna build a working elevator for the office building?  The stone building in the park is up for grabs as is the space south of it.  Jackson Avenue is unbilt and is supposed to contain abandoned houses.  Brisbain avenue is the former rich neighborhood -- abandoned mansions.
<BR>
That's the Bellona section, anyway.  The theme is Delany or Virtual-Light-Gibson sorta stuff.
<BR>
For William Burroughs fans, we are starting an Interzone section.  This will be reachable only via virtual drug abuse.  It is exotic and sensual, both a place and an altered state of consciousness.  Rent the movie "Naked Lunch" if you want to see what it is all about.  Look at #421.

Subj: Byte Quota
<BR>

<BR>
This should go in the newspaper, but I think everyone reads this.

We have now switched over to byte quota instead of object quota. To see how much quota you have, type @quota.
<BR>

<BR>
To see how to measure your objects, type `help @measure'.
<BR>

<BR>
Most everyone has 25k of byte quota now. Those of you who received more quota previously under the old system got 2k more per object above the default of 7 that you had. So if you had a quota of 15, you now have 25k + 8*2k = 41k.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm going to port over a few nice utilities from Lambda in a bit to help see where your space is being used up in.

Dhalgren is running a hopefully improved server compiled with R4000 optimizations and SGI's faster version of malloc.  SGI claims that standard malloc degrades in long-running processes that do a lot of allocation and deallocation.  And we have observed some unusual server bloat and a little sluggishness after Dhalgren has been up for a week or so.
<BR>
Keep your fingers crossed.  If the server bombs, we can quickly restore the old version.

Subj: returning to old malloc
<BR>

<BR>
Well after watching the server grow from 1126 pages to 2348 in six days, I decided to return to the old version of malloc.  Of course malloc fragmentation might not have been the cause of this memory leak.  (Yes, we DO have Pavel's latest memory-leak-fix installed)

<BR>
OK, no more reboots.  Our system administrators rebooted our machines today, and then an X-window debacle forced us to reboot again.  We expect Dhalgren to run for weeks and weeks now.  Sorry.
<BR>
By the way, for those who don't know this, X-windows sucks bit time.

The Interzone section of the MOO is now linked to Bellona.  To get there, find the Bellona Bus Depot (#609) on Broadway just south of the stone lions.  William Burroughs fans can build and link here.  Enjoy!

Subj: Generic Wandering Automaton
<BR>

<BR>
I've created a Generic Wandering Automaton class that builds on the
<BR>
Generic Automaton.  It allows you to create an automaton that will
<BR>
roam from room to room randomly, pausing while people are interacting
<BR>
with it.  The three commands it currently has on it are:
<BR>

<BR>
@start <automaton name>   -- starts the wandering behavior
<BR>
@stop  <automaton name>   -- stops the wandering
<BR>
@setcycle <automaton name> -- sets the interval between moves
<BR>

<BR>

Taxi service is now available on Dhalgren.  This is an idea borrowed from FurryMUCK, and it's also a way to point out interesting places to new players.  You should be able to type "taxi" (an exit name) on most streets in Dhalgren.

Subj: Ideas
<BR>

<BR>
Ok...
<BR>

<BR>
I've got several ideas for projects and the like which I'd like to bounce around for y'all to consider.  I haven't read Dhalgren (just ordered it today) and only a bit of Dick or Burroughs, so some of it may be unthemely.  I'd like your opinions, just post here if you have any.  This list has been kinda quiet lately anyhow.  Now, on with the ideas...
<BR>

<BR>
1.  A "Fluid" Player Class, which I've already begun a bit of work on.  One of the most annoying and least convincing aspects of MOO to me is the aspect of having a static, unchanging desc.  What I'm envisioning is a PC that would allow you to define a slew of "desc snippets" which would be randomly shuffled and placed into your desc whenever :look() is called.  This appears to me to be an easy hack, as it's all just randomization, and message setting.  I have a lot of ideas re: customization, but the question I'm asking is where it should be in the hierarchy.  Should it be a kid of UUPC or Scorpion?  Would there be enough interest in such a PC to place it between UUPC and Scorpion in the hierarchy?
<BR>

<BR>
2.  Areas to build.  For some reason, I really like the idea of an espresso stand/tattoo parlor.  How about Bellona's City Hall?  I can envision the City Hall being something akin to either a boardinghouse or market/temple.  Good idea?  Bad idea?
<BR>

<BR>
3.  Literary stuff.  I've read a smattering of PKD's most paranoid novels, mainly the Valis books, and am wondering if these could be fit into Dhalgren at all.  This is where I get a bit hazy on theme... Would a Valis satellite, floating in geo-synchronous orbit over Bellona be feasible?  How to tie the two together?
<BR>

<BR>
4.  Cults, secret societies.  The theme of Dhalgren mentions "secret cults;" a MOO idea which I love, in theory, but can never figure out how to implement.  I considered creating an area on CyberSphere ruled by cult members, but ran into the same problem that others there had with developing corporations and the like -- how does one create incentive to join a "MOO organization?"  And, doesn't this create a level of hassle that this place would most rather ignore?  The idea of people running around VRs, scheming and conniving is a really sexy one to me.  It adds a layer of mystery and intrigue, a feeling of never quite knowing exactly what's going on.  We need cults!
<BR>

<BR>
5.  New bot idea.  How about bots that walk around, exchanging gossip and information about players?  They can overhear snippets of conversations, wander around the MOO, bump into one another and randomly trade bits of information.  Just an idea, could be interesting.
<BR>

<BR>
Well, that's about it for now.  Like I said, I'm still not sure I'm fitting into the theme particularly well yet, so feel free to ding any of the previous ideas if they appear to be at odds with what this MOO is all about.

Subj: re: ideas
<BR>

<BR>
Good ideas from El!  The fluid player player class might be based on a program that substitutes random words into text.  :description() could call that, as could other things.  I could write my Insulting FO with such a tool.
<BR>
Some sort of market area (and "Agora") would be cool.  This could go in Interzone too (just reminding folks of that Willima Burroughs area).  Or it could go in Bellona.
<BR>
I really like the idea of a VALIS satellite.  Horselover also mentioned this.  You all should do it!  A pink laser beam could zap people in outdoor locations.
<BR>
Cults -- by all means.  Start a new secular religion.  Marlowe and I have talked about that some.  I'd love to chat about it.
<BR>
A wondering gosiping bot sounds cool.  Marcus had a similar idea -- litter, wandering notes that you can read and write on.

I've modified The Generic Ambient Noise Room #176 so that the owner can just turn the whole noise behavior off without clearing the noise property.

<BR>
This may be useful for debugging or for just taking a break from the noises.

It's done by setting the .active property to 0. To turn it back on, change the prop back to 1 and use the new `@restart' verb.

I've just created the PARC with Seats. You can define any number of virtual seats in your room with customized messages.

See `help #955' for details on how it works and what you need to do to set them up.

Note: The room makes no attempt to put the seats in the description. That's up to you. When someone is sitting in the seat, that does show up in the description when someone looks.
<BR>

<BR>
You can use the PARC's @detail command to give your seat a description that people see when they do `look <seat>'.

Subj: quota and programming policy
<BR>

<BR>
We've had a few discussions about policy and I've thought some about this.  Let me make a couple quick comments to clarify the situation with quota and prog bits.
<BR>

<BR>
Dhalgren runs on a very fast machine (the MIPS R4400 is faster than LambdaMOO's CPU), but one that has relatively little RAM (32 megabytes).  For the time being we hope to keep the database down below 5 or 6 meg.  Its 2.7 meg now.  Players start out with 25K, which is enough to build a number of rooms and toys.  We hope people will concentrate on making a few quality things rather than a lot of scenery.  Any wizard can give you 50K if they like what you do, and more than 50 is possible with some inter-wizard discussion.
<BR>

<BR>
Prob bits are given out pretty freely.  Unlike LambdaMOO and PostModernCulture, we do not allow anti-social verbs here.  We encourage free artistic expression, but this does not include programs designed to attack or annoy players.  Sexual harassment is a toadable offense.  Spamming people, making them fart or vomit or other such action spoofs will get prog bits turned off.  Creating provocative objects is OK.  A player can go into a museum and see a Maplethorp picture and get pissed off -- but he can't go in a museum and have something out of a malplethorp picture HAPPEN to him.
<BR>

<BR>
Well, this isn't written by a lawyer, so I hope the intension is clear.  The difference between "provocative" and "hostile" is subjective, and since we have really had no problems yet, let's just leave it at this for now.

I think the page verb on MOOs is broken.  Shouldn't it echo back what you paged to you (so it appears in log files).  When I speak, I see what I say.  When I page, it just disappears into the ether.  Its easy to fix, but the question is should we?

<BR>

<BR>
Well, we could certainly hack page to echo like that, but it would add to spam lots. 
<BR>

<BR>
Though paging usually ends up as being conversation, it shouldn't really be so equal to being in the same room with your other party and just using :say.
<BR>

<BR>
Besides, from looking at the screen:
<BR>

<BR>
page dred this is a test
<BR>
Your message has been sent to Dred.
<BR>

<BR>
Becomes something like:
<BR>

<BR>
page dred this is a test
<BR>
You page, "this is a test" to Dred.
<BR>
Your message has been sent to Dred.
<BR>

<BR>
I guess we could kill the second line, but then custom page_echo's go out the window. I like them, myself. And the above lines would look like I just said it to the room, or whispered to Dred who was in the same room...
<BR>

<BR>
The distinction reduces confusion. But I do see Patro's point about logs. Although, do you mean client or MOO logs? Client logs will have the line you typed as well as the responses. We don't have too MOO log mechanisms here as far as I know.

You've done it again you incompetent!"
<BR>
Funny, Patro, I was just thinking about this very thing...
<BR>

<BR>
I think pages should echo, not only for logging but so we can 
<BR>
read our own lines as they go out (some of us have a bad habit
<BR>
of proofreading as we go, futile as it may seem).
<BR>

<BR>
I agree with Dred that three lines to send a page is spammy and 
<BR>
that page echoes are particularly nice. I also think he's dred 
<BR>
on when he says paging shouldn't really be the same as saying 
<BR>
or whispering. The distinction is very important to preserve VR.
<BR>

<BR>
The solution might be to integrate the page_echo_msg with the 
<BR>
line paged, so...
<BR>

<BR>
page marcus You've done it again you incompetent!
<BR>
In Stage Manager's Office, Marcus raises an eyebrow. You page, 
<BR>
 "You've done it again you incompetent!"
<BR>

<BR>
This is two lines to reduce spam but the page_echo-msg 
<BR>
lengthens the line and signals (preserves the distinctiveness 
<BR>
of) paging.
<BR>

<BR>
Hell, maybe all those args can be strung together and sent to 
<BR>
 who:page_echo_msg() for an optional string substitution...?
<BR>

<BR>
Cause I always like to read my text a second time...;-)

I guess I am expecting page to act like whisper.  Page echo could be sacrificed.  Page announce messages are still cool.  And people could customize a message to be returned when they are not logged in (canyou do that now?).

<BR>
This is just speculation, not an urgant problem.  But in fact tf doesn't seem to LOG what I type, only what is echoed back from the MOO.  So anything I page is not logged.

There is a trash bin on the corner by the stone lions (the park entrance).  This is an exit to a room with no exits.  Litter and pets that wander indiscriminatnly will eventually end up here.
<BR>

<BR>
This will give litter a nice half-life.  I like litter, but we need a sink as well as a source for it.  Folks can rescue their favorite items from the Trash Bin if they want to put it back in circulation.

Subj: Some virtual privacy features
<BR>

<BR>
Looking at remote objects is a peculiar (but sometimes handy) feature of MOOs.  I have partially disabled that feature on some room and player classes now.
<BR>

<BR>
Rooms of the Secured Post-Apocalypse Room (#262) type cannot be seen by anyone not actually in the room if its security level is not Open or its free_entry is zero.
<BR>

<BR>
The Scorpion Player Class (#153) now has a new message.  If you are an ancestor of this class (which I recommend on Dhalgren), you can make yourself unviewable remotely by setting:
<BR>

<BR>
       @remote_see me is NO

<BR>
An adjustment has been made to the ban verb on litter: now
<BR>
not only may the owner use ban to limit its range, but also 
<BR>
any player may ban given pieces of litter from eir spaces.
<BR>
Type 'ban <litter> from <wherever>' and the litter won't
<BR>
blow back in after it blows out (but you can only ban it
<BR>
from rooms you own).
<BR>

<BR>
Also, the default interval between litter's blowing from room 
<BR>
to room has been changed from five minutes to ten.
<BR>

<BR>
If litter appears to you as spam, however, the easy way to 
<BR>
clear your screen is to pick it up, thereby preventing it from 
<BR>
blowing around. (You might drop it again when you log off.)
<BR>

Subj: SIGGRAPH
<BR>

<BR>
I had a good time at SIGGRAPH in Orlando.  About 30,000 people attend this conference on computer graphics.  There were several fascinating panel discussions on virtual reality (including one chaired by Kidd/Moose!).
<BR>

<BR>
I was struck by comments (particularly by William Bricken and others) about separating "display" and "action" as concepts in virtual reality.  MUDs were pointed out as an intersting example of the central importants of action, since there is no grahpical display (an amusing fact to point out at SIGGRAPH).  Bricken talks about boundaries between spaces.  The keyboard and screen are a boundary between RL and the digital computer.  The software interface is a boundary between the computer and VR.  Most operating systems reveal a great deal of the nuts and bolts of the digital computer domain to the user -- something programs think they want but other users may not.  Ideally, the interface to VR should hide the digital domain and give the user the illusion of a single boundary between RL and VR -- direct manipulation of objects in VR and a sense of presense in VR.
<BR>

<BR>
Brenda Laurel talked about her experimental VR system called "Placeholder" inwhich users enter the bodies of animal totems (Crow, Snake, Spider, Fish).  Each of these characters has a "body" with special strengths and weaknesses.  Their voices are altered electronically, the fish can see underwater, the snake can see infra-red.  This made me think about experiments one could do on a MUD with certain player classes and room classes.

Okay, so I was thinking about it, and it really is confusing the way it is now for the pronoun substitutions on the Generic Wearable thing #550.

In the worn_msg for clothing (children of #550):
<BR>

%n, %o, %p, %s, %r, %q all refer to who is wearing the clothing (And assumes that they have the clothing in their inventory)
<BR>
%d refers to the player looking at them.
<BR>
%t refers to the clothing itself
<BR>

I went ahead and changed the messages for those people who went to my new way. Sorry about the confusion. All the children of #550 should work fine now.

Subj: generic rooms and stuff
<BR>

<BR>
An integrating room sounds good.  Folks interested in generics should look at the box in the alley (#120) which contains the local Dhalgren generics.  The Post-Apocalypse Room (#110) supports details and also supports the Bellona daytime and weather substitutions.  #262 is a version of PARC with security.  Another child of PARC supports Lambda-style seats (#955) and yet another supports a generalization of seats (Room with Stacking, #563).  Let's make the integrating room at least be a child of PARC so we get the MOO-wide weather/and time stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
Player classes are also continuing to evolve.  The lit-theory folks and I have been having an endless discussion about embodiment in VR, which I hope will lead to an interesting set of PC features someday.  Right now, the main Dhalgren player class is the Scorpion PC (#153).    That's a work in progress to some extent.
<BR>

<BR>
I'd like to generally encourage people to try new things.  Dhalgren is not LambdaMOO.  I'm certainly prepared to shower anyone with quota who wants to explore new concepts in VR, and am not very keen on porting the Lambda environment to here.

Jim Apsnes invented TinyMUD in 1988, and a sequence of MUDs ran at CMU in 1989 and 1990.  TinyMUD classic (Apr89-Aug90) and Islandia (Jan90-Nov90) were among the first.  Much of Islandia's population moved to FurryMUCK during the summer of 1990.  LambdaMOO started in Jan91.
<BR>

<BR>
The MUCK and MOO servers are later stages in the evolution of TinyMUD, but if somehow one were able to look at a bit of the past, I think you'd be amazed by how much of the familiar character of MUDs appeared very early.  If you had been able to use @rose back then, you'd notice that a lot of what people program with verbs today was done back then with exist, messages, and locking.  But of course that was all long ago...

As a lycanthrope, you may set your description to change

with Bellona daytime and weather, too. In addition, wearables

which have appropriate properties and markup can also change

accordingly...so, for example, you can make a hat that gets

wet when it rains.
<BR>

<BR>
More usefully, as a thespian this pc may wear costumes.

<BR>
no godlike powers like @create, @go, page, @move) has given me an idea for
<BR>
a basic Material milieu that could probably be run off a Lambdacore system.
<BR>
I have neither the time nor the system savvy to do anything with this, but
<BR>
maybe one of us can be inspired by this idea ...
<BR>

<BR>
MaterialMOO Objects
<BR>
 All objects would have the following basic properties: material, size/mass,
<BR>
quality, form, and containment capacity (expressed in size units).
<BR>
I would start out with only a few simple materials -- wood, iron, gold. The 
<BR>
material would be included in the desc, which could be further customized by
<BR>
the creator. Ex. "An axe made of iron. The handle is graven with runes."
<BR>
Size/mass would govern players' ability to carry and wield the object, as
<BR>
well as containment of the object. Form is self-explanatory; if 0, the object
<BR>
is a hunk of raw material. Quality would be a minimum-function of the quality
<BR>
of raw material and the skill of the player who created it. Objects could be
<BR>
damaged, reduced in quality until they are scrap (unworkable raw material).
<BR>

<BR>
Object forms: These would be master templates specifying creation and use of
<BR>
objects. By creation I mean what skill is needed to make the object, and the
<BR>
type, amount, and quality of raw material needed. Use would incorporate verbs
<BR>
usable by all the form's kids -- for an axe, these might be "chop <wooden obj>"
<BR>
and "attack <player>". Better-quality objects would be more efficient.
<BR>

<BR>
Players: Players would have skills in crafts and fighting, possibly
<BR>
others such as climbing, swimming, concealment, stealth ... Combat
<BR>
would be fairly simple, and the victor would be given the choice of
<BR>
killing the defeated player, robbing him/her, or letting him/her go.
<BR>

<BR>
Ethics would be encouraged by a "karma debt" assessed upon killing or
<BR>
robbing; players who die in a state of bad karma would not be
<BR>
recycled, but sent to a Hell, preventing the user from creating a new
<BR>
player. Of course this open up lots of possibilities: psychic players
<BR>
who can sense karma, plenary indulgences for a fee, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
Milieu: An important feature of this MOO would be management of a
<BR>
player's off- time. There would be areas -- logging camps, mines, and
<BR>
the like -- where a player could go to and "work" while disconnected.
<BR>
Upon reconnecting he or she would be "paid" in materials proportional
<BR>
to the off-time spent there. There would also be guilds, where skills
<BR>
could be learned during off-time for a fee; and making objects could
<BR>
also require off-time involvement.
<BR>
 The economy would be set up initially with NPC merchants, guilds,
<BR>
and the like,but players could find it more advantageous to strike
<BR>
deals with each other.  A "swap" verb would facilitate the
<BR>
simultaneous exchange of goods.
<BR>
 "Sleeping" outside a work area or a secured building could be a
<BR>
perilous proposition, depending on the mercies of fellow players; but
<BR>
to be fair to unintentionally disconnected players, characters might
<BR>
be given the ability  to defend themselves automatically, or head for
<BR>
a secure area.
<BR>

<BR>
Expansion: The milieu would become more interesting as the wizards --
<BR>
really, the "gods" -- introduced more and different materials,
<BR>
animals, and forms.  Master craftspeople could suggest new ideas for
<BR>
forms. The gods could create challenges and adventures. Etc ...
<BR>

Elisabeth Reid has written a masters thesis on MUDs that is well worth reading.  The title is _Cultural Formations in Text-Based Virtual Realities_ and you can obtain it via http://www.ee.mu.oz.au/papers/emr/index.html
<BR>
This paper gives a good history of MUDs and a critical discussion of language, politics and sex in social- and adventure-style MUDs.  You may have seen her previous paper _Electropolis: Communication and Community on Internet Relay Chat_ which was also quite interesting.

Subj: Refusals
<BR>

<BR>
I've set up refusals here on Dhalgren. They reside on #396, a player class near the top of the hierarchy.
<BR>

<BR>
Refusable actions are:
<BR>
        mail    move    page    whisper
<BR>

<BR>
We might add more later. The command syntax is:
<BR>

<BR>
        @refuse <action> from <player-list> [for <time interval>]
<BR>

<BR>
Where:
<BR>

<BR>
<action> is one or more of the above separated by spaces. Or the word
<BR>
         `everything' to mean them all.
<BR>

<BR>
<player-list> is a list of players separeted by spaces. Or the word
<BR>
              `everyone' to mean everyone. If you use `guests', it will 
<BR>
              refer to all guests.
<BR>

<BR>
<time interval> is the english words duration. Such as:  1 month, 2 weeks,
<BR>
                1 day, 5 minutes, etc. Leaving off the [for <time interval>] 
<BR>
                part will make it default to 1 week. Using the words
<BR>
                `forever' or `for ever' will mean just that.
<BR>

<BR>
Examples:
<BR>

<BR>
        @refuse move whisper from dredful patro for 2 weeks
<BR>
        @refuse everything from everyone
<BR>
        @refuse everything from everyone forever
<BR>
        @refuse everything from guests for 1 month
<BR>

<BR>
And so on.
<BR>

<BR>
Similarly, to remove refusals:
<BR>

<BR>
        @unrefuse <action> from <player-list>
<BR>

<BR>
Which works exactly the same except time-intervals are not needed.
<BR>

<BR>
To see your refusals, simply type @refusals.

I've just chparented #176 Generic Ambient Noise Room, over to Sick's #459 Generic Integrating Room.

Now anything with a .look_msg can be integrated into the room's description. See help #459 for details.

Subj: #176 & #459
<BR>

<BR>
for those of you who are interested/concerned, i'll make a few comments about dredful's previous post.
<BR>
sick (the owner of #459) and i asked dredful to move that room further up the hierarchy so that all rooms inherit integrating.  this way, if you want a room with seats that also integrates, you can have it.  it just seemed a logical option to have for all the rooms that are descended from #176.
<BR>
i have, at dredful's request (and a good one at that) changed the default of #459.integrating to be -1.  this means that player objects with a look_self_msg will _not_ be integrated into the room's description by default.  we decided to do this as a security measure, to avoid possible spying.
<BR>
what this means: all children of #459 (and now all descendents) will by default not integrate the .look_self_msg of players, although it will still do so for objects with a .look_self_msg.  to get rid of integration, set your room's .integration = 0.  to integrate players and objects, set it to 1.
<BR>
for those of you who have rooms parented directly to #459, if those rooms' .integration was something other than -1, chances are you're gonna have to go through the pain-inna-ass task of setting them again, to whatever they were before.  sorry.  but it's for the best, in the end.  :)
<BR>
also, the room owner's objects and residents of the room are `hidden' when their look_msg is a non-string, just for your information.
<BR>
if you still have questions, look at the help for #459, page me (Eclipse), or mail sick.
<BR>
changes, changes,

Subj: it's here!
<BR>

<BR>
fellow denizens of dhalgren:
<BR>
the future is here.  yes, now you can have your tattoo and wear it, too!  The Tattoo Den is here, ready and waiting to service you, the self-decorating hipsters of the post-apocalypse era.
<BR>
There's a bit of explaining that goes along with this, so pay attention.  :)
<BR>
To get to the Tattoo Den, simply go southwest from The Crossroads (#113) into the large office building.  When you enter the lobby, go east into the elevator shaft, make your way up to the fifth floor, and go west.  You are here.
<BR>
At the Tattoo Den, Biker Bob is waiting for you to come in and get the tattoo you've always dreamed of.  What you want is what you get: name, description, place on the body, the whole nine yards.  What's more, they're permanant.
<BR>
These tattoos cannot be removed from your body but by two methods: you can @eject it, or you can go back to the Tattoo Den to have Dr. Sass, our tattoo remover specialist, surgically remove your tattoo from your body with her high-tech laser gun.  These tattoos cannot me @moved by you or anyone else; nor can they be taken off, dropped, stolen, given away, or left lying around.
<BR>
And yes, the tattoo _will_ be integrated into your description, but here's the catch: you have to be a child of the Generic PC with Integrated Contents (#1986).  Due to circumstances beyond my control, this pc does not have the features of the Scorpion or Lycanthropic pcs.  Only children of #1986 (and it's descendents - of which there are none, yet) will be able to have their tattoo's description integrated into their own.  The GPCIC is a child of the Useful Utilitarian PC (#99), so be warned: you will be giving up the features of the Scorpion and other pc's if you @chparent to this class.
<BR>
However, if you don't wish to @chparent, don't be crushed just yet.  If you are not a child of #1986 and you get a tattoo, it will instead show up in your contents.  Not quite as realistic, but better than nothing.
<BR>
So, with this formal announcement of the opening of the Tattoo Den (#2130), I invite you to head on up there yourself and check it out.  There is a receptionist waiting to answer your questions, and there is no lack of helpful signs.
<BR>
Voila - tattoo you - and enjoy.
<BR>
the mother of necessity,
<BR>

Subj: The Crash
<BR>

<BR>
So, why did Sick cause this crash?  He caused the one on Lambda just shortly before this one, so it looks as though he was attempting to see if the server bug was actually a bug and not a coincidendental crash.  There were around 5 or 6 others connected to Dhalgren at the time of the crash.  I lost a minute amount of stuff, I don't know what others lost.  I don't think that's the point, though.  It looks to me as though he was testing the bug on "the lesser MOOs," and that looks like a malicious disregard towards the other members of this MOO.
<BR>

<BR>
After recycling my previous character, I created a mess for the wizards to deal with, which I have apologized for.  When I got this character, I was denied a progbit for several months, due to my malicious disregard of the havoc that my recycling incurred on the db.  Therefore, I suggest that, at the very least, Sick be deprogged due to this.  I don't think that, qualitatively, anyone would argue that crashing the server (which then, obviously, remained down for several days) is a more minor offense than recycling one's self.
<BR>

<BR>
I don't think that the players of Dhalgren would appreciate others using this server and db as a testing ground for server bugs.  Do you?

Is this a MOO with its own identity or is it just a refuge from Lambda for a select few who can afford to set up their own lag-free paging environment?

So, how are we defining "more happenin'" here?  True, there haven't been consistently sizeable crowds around lately, but I'm not convinced that this means that we need to start advertising.  For as long as I've been around, there's been a big variation in the number of people who hang out here.  Do low numbers = Bad MOO?  I personally am pretty happy that we're not having the sort of population explosion that LM suffers from.    My feeling, basically, is:  if you want to build something cool, build it.  If you want your friends to come hang out, give them the address.  I'm just not sure that you can quantify how "happenin'" any given MOO is, unless you're using LM as the standard.  
<BR>

<BR>
If we're trying to be LM, though, I guess we'll need to start filling some crucial positions.  Can I be *Sunny*?

Subj: My Take on Stagnation
<BR>

<BR>
1.  I didn't mean to imply that since I couldn't think of something to write that therefore this MOO is boring.  Chalk that up to my poor communication skills.  Not all of us teach composition.
<BR>
2.  A MOO with lots of people doesn't equate with exciting to me.  Simply because I find this MOO dullsville atm doesn't necessarily mean that I want more or different people here.  I simply want to see something interesting to me.
<BR>

<BR>
Therefore, my point (which I should've made clear before) is:  I am bored, there is little here that interests me.  This makes me sad, as I used to enjoy this MOO much more.  I wish to express this dissatisfaction with everyone with the hopes that maybe it'll spur someone on to do *something*.  Since the last interesting thing I can recall being done here was created over a month or so ago (mel's fun elevator in the Labry), then I don't think it's unfair to claim that not much (or not much that's being made public) is going on.
<BR>

<BR>
Either post to *g with announcements of the new, neat things everyone's done, or do something.  If I could think of anything to do, I would.  This request applies to me, too.

I don't really want to broadly advertise Dhalgren.  I don't think it will be that interesting to the general MUDing crowd.  Dhalgren is basically a group of like-minded folks who left LamdbaMOO because it was too crowded to support a community.  I think there are plenty of MUDs on the internet to entertain anyone who is bored here.
<BR>

<BR>
I'd like to encourage literary-theory, media, and architecture people to come here and experiment.  I had dinner with William Mitchell at MIT (the dean of the architecture school) a few days ago, and he is very interested in the issues of how a city is designed and how to rethink that design in virtual reality.  Some friends at NYU are involved in the YORB project, which is an on-line television experiment connected with ECHO.
<BR>

<BR>
I think a logical place to start some experiments and discussion might be to begin a new section of Dhalgren.  We have Bellona and Interzone.  The new section we have been discussing is Vermillion Sands, a near-future desert resort which is the setting for some of J.G.Ballard's short stories.  How about starting a mailing list to discuss generics and topology and other ideas for this project?

Btw, I like the Vermillion Sands idea without having read any Ballard.  Simply the idea of trying to incorporate other authors' "worlds" is pretty neat to me.  I used to think that doing something Dick-ish would be neat, but I'm not sure which of his books would be neat.  It'd be kinda hard to make an Ubikworld or Valisland, IMHO.  :-)

arc, your last post gave me a very interesting idea.  one which, if i find that there's interest in it, i might be willing to pursue.  you (and patro) mentioned incorporating the settings of other authour's books into chalgren to expand a little.  i've read a very interesting book (and it's sequel) by a woman named joan d. vinge, whose setting, i think, would make an interesting addition to dhalgren.
<BR>
basically, the place i had in mind was the city of carbuncle, which more or less a city that sits in the middle of an ocean.  it's as if it was built on an island and overran the island, becoming a sort of floating city.  it's a very futuristic sort of place, where offworld technology and on-planet tradition come together (of sorts).  i'm planning on trying to explain the basic story of the book on *coolthingstoread, so if you're looking for a little more background, you might check there in a while.
<BR>
anyhow, i'd like to ponder this some more: how it might fit in, what it's purpose might be, where it might be located, etc.  i know this isn't much to go on just yet, but is there any interest in this sort of a place?  i know that i'd be interested in building it or seeing it built. :)

I'd love to see something done with Vinge's Carbuncle.  Structurally it's interesting because of the spiraliness of it, and because the hall of winds would be fun to build.

I've read _Snow Queen_ and liked it.  My friend brij (*sigh*) turned me on to it.  It's a lush fantasy/adventure story set on a watery planet in the distant future.  I'm not sure that fits into the overall theme of Dhalgren, which is set on Earth in the near future.
<BR>

<BR>
Let me say a little about _Vermilion Sands_, which is the setting for a collection of short stories by J.G.Ballard.  Ballard was one of the founders of the British "new wave" science fiction, with books like _Drowned World_.  Vermilion Sands is a desert resort inhabitated by the bored and jaded people of a world where automation had pretty much left nothing for anyone to do with their time.  People build sonic sculptures, make art with clouds, breed flowers that sing and scorpions encrusted with saphires.  Its quite atmospheric, like Delany's Dhalgren book.  Not quite as punk as Dhalgren, but very postmodern -- not a technological utopia.  Technology has forced people to question their purpose, people still get into intricate interpersonal conflicts.

Subj: jaded futures
<BR>

<BR>
As long as one is considering futures where there's nothing to do but make decadent art, consider Michael Moorcock's "Dancers at the End of Time" trilogy, which starts with _An Alien Heat_.  It's great fun, and very MOOlike already, considering that the (very far future human) characters constantly change appearance and gender and can make anything they want with a turn of a power ring, much of which is in abominable taste.  Most of their works are somehow based on historical records, but a lot has been lost in translation, so that, for example, Jherek Carnelian's reconstruction of a British 19th-century house for the comfort of his time-traveller includes a wurlitzer and a giant aspidistra _tree_, and he serves her raw beef and neat whiskey for breakfast.
<BR>
I think the End of Time stuff resoundingly appropriate for MOO-modelling.

Actually I've never interpreted theme here as _entirely_ American, near future, as the 'near future' of Delaney, Burroughs and Dick (currently approved canonical theme-models) was actually somewhere in the late '60s, early '70s.

While I'd not necessarily like to see vast, patchwork, vaguely sci-fi tinysprawl, I think there's room to open up the canon a bit as it were, to include things like SCI FI BY WOMEN WRITERS for instance.  I think that in terms of interesting architecture and interesting use of myth, Vinge is highly appropriate, if not strictly themely.
<BR>
I think that the usual standards for building: very well planned, very well-written and as interactive as possible should apply.

As I read this discussion of What to Build, the issue that I keep returning to is this:  -Why- to Build?
<BR>

<BR>
Let me immediately say that I think that the ideas people are tossing around sound interesting and fun.  I'm not questioning those ideas -specifically-; I'm just wanting to poke at the idea of building a new area in general.  We've currently got a pretty small core group of people who consistently hang out here, so it's not like we (imo) -need- the space of a new area, and as far as I can tell, the theme of Bellona is pretty damned flexible.  Okay, so that's part of my question, but it's a fairly silly part.  Who cares if we -need- new space if we -want- new space?  What I wonder at this point, though, is what that new space will -do-.  One of the things that I really like about this MOO is that, for me, at least, there's a definite sense of community.  Will that change if we build a big new area and half of the people like it so much they decide to @sethome over there?  I just think that's something to consider:  if we're just building because we're bored or stagnant or whatever, how is a bunch of echoing tinyscenery going to make us more exciting?
<BR>

<BR>
Even though I've got these concerns about new building, I still like the idea.  I just think that any concept that we come up with should have some sort of more-than-just-scenic quality included on the level of the idea.  This is something that I've been thinking about lately, how to play around with narrative &c in MOOtext.  I hope to build some stuff that experiments with narrative (the elevator in the Labry is probably the kind of thing I'm thinking of here).  So that's one way to approach interactivity.  Another one, obviously, is programming.  I'm a horrid coder, so I'm trying to kind of think -around- the need for verbs, but I can imagine some amazing verbs to go along with the kinds of new areas we're talking about.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyway, those are just a couple of actual ideas.  Of course I don't have anything more specific, heh.  I just thought I'd throw this concern into the discussion.

<BR>
Mel is right about tinyscenery.  We are a small MUD, not running on a huge machine like FurryMUCK or LambdaMOO.  Our database could probably double in size, and after that I think we'd start to have trouble.  Quality is much more important than quantity -- if you want to build things that have an impact, a carefully crafted space like Club Dred on LMOO is worth a thousand rooms of tinyscenery that no one ever visits.
<BR>

<BR>
One reason I have been thinking about Vermilion Sands is that some friends in the school of architecture at MIT are interested in experimenting with virtual-city design.  Topological planning for social usage is a fascinating subject.  I think Dhalgren, like most MUDs, has problems in that area, and it would be interesting to experiment with this.  I would say that Dhalgren has not yet found its social heart, its "rec room" or its "tree house" or its "living room".  Maybe this is partly because the newcomer is not really presented with an obvious place to go when he or she logs in here.  I'm hoping that the MIT people might have some cool ideas about this problem.

Subj: Areas
<BR>

<BR>
I generally agree with mel about the non-need for big, museum-piece areas here, though not because the topographic dispersion has any impact on the social life here -- I don't think tehre is enough of a transient popoulation here to make a 'living room' really necessary -- last year people pretty much socialized wherever they found themselves, and it was good.
<BR>
Or, let me rephrase that -- I am all for museum-piece areas as long as they are interestingly interactive, embodying novel VR/hyperliterary ideas. But I'm also for an intensifying of the existing space (as I've tried to do with my stalls in the park bathroom, and with my conversational 'bot-type).
<BR>
I don't see why we can't bring new ideas into the existing space. Patro suggested Octavia Butler -- I don't think her vision would be served so much by an area, as by the kind of modular additions to PERSONAL experience that her novels explore.
<BR>
(Translate this, loosely, to mean feature objects,  generics, player classes, bot-types ... character concepts ...)
<BR>
I'd also like to suggest getting beyond the 'replication' of other authors' concepts, and using them as inspiration for one's own personal vision, in a (gasp) post-a-modern brick-o-lage kinda way.
<BR>
Kinda like what I've done with Gibson's Dog Solitude, and (though more literally faithfully) what Patro's done with Interzone.

Subj: More Ideas
<BR>

<BR>
First off, I should note that I was given more quota recently (by legba) for the sole purpose of building stuff and attempting to foster more community organization.  So, there seems to be a wizardly desire to get things rolling here, mel.  Patro's Vermillion Sands sounds wonderful to me.  However, although I love the Islandia and MUDClassic stuff, what purpose are they serving here?  I feel that this is a major problem with this MOO... we have all sorts of neat things lying around that no one ever uses.  In this sense, I'm afraid that no matter how many new things we build, people will just get bored with them and retreat to their rooms to page about the latest scandals.  So, I'm not sure what my point is.  Uh.
<BR>
Um, I guess my second point is that I wholeheartedly agree with Trism that only copying the already-created worlds of sci-fi authors is a dead end.  Perhaps that's part of the problem here?  While Bellona is undoubtedly a great framing element to this MOO, most of the major projects have been "fleshing out" projects rather than pure creating projects -- by this, I mean that they've been towards the goal of detailing something in Dhalgren or in something of Burrough's work rather than creating much out of the recesses of our own heads.  What I love about LambdaMOO is that we see much more of a non-previously-written aspect to the vr.  Take, for instance, the Barn.  A great idea, with some fun stuff inside it... as far as I know, it was inspired by something literary, but didn't confine itself to replication.  legba, what was the inspiration again?  Anyhow, I'm planning on creating a section decidedly NON-LITERARY and NON-POMO here.  Anyone else interested, please contact me.

Intersting ideas.  I think I agree that it would be better to work on Bellona rather than start a new area.  I don't believe in the idea of interactive fiction, so I don't see us using other author's work like that.  Bellona has some of the geography, language and atmosphere of Delany's book, but beyond that it is up to people's creativity.
<BR>

<BR>
As for Islandia, I think it's interesting to those of us here who are taking an explicit interest in text-VR and its history and forms.  And besides, #2 likes it too much to delete.  :-)

<BR>
The barn on Lambda isn't a literary ref, it's out of my very own head.  Mr. Ed needed somewhere to live is all, a bunch of anarchists, queers and assorted spares needed somewhere to link and etc.  Good writing counts for a lot, and we certainly need not be derivative.

Subj: MOO plots
<BR>

<BR>
Marcus comes in late on these things...a few reactions to the 
<BR>
recent discussions.
<BR>

<BR>
First off, I think we should all encourage Eclipse and whoever
<BR>
else to move forward and experiment. Those ideas sound really
<BR>
cool. I think, too, that good building happens when someone has
<BR>
a good idea and goes through with it, puts a personal stamp on
<BR>
it. Building by committee is even worse on MOO than elsewhere.
<BR>
I also have high regard for Ballard and would love to see some
<BR>
well-put-together Ballard-inspired stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
I also have other thoughts, sort of MOO-theory in line with the
<BR>
excellent MOO-theory we've seen from melusina, Trismegistos,
<BR>
Arc--everyone, really. Fundamentally I agree with the
<BR>
conclusion legba and Patro have come to, that more than 'more
<BR>
space' what happens _within_ the spaces is the best indication
<BR>
of how good the MOO is (citing Club Dred as a model); yet
<BR>
likewise it's not just 'more happening' but 'how good' is that
<BR>
happening. Spammy theory in the message to follow....

Subj: MOO Theory
<BR>

<BR>
Much as it seems like a space, the MOO is of course a text
<BR>
 framed to emulate a space.
<BR>
  (Actually it's both more fluid (@go, page) and more rigid
<BR>
   than space--you can't turn your head and look into just any
<BR>
   corner.)
<BR>
But what we are really aiming for, after all, is a certain
<BR>
 expressiveness of text, and the rewards of such (a range of)
<BR>
 expressiveness.
<BR>

<BR>
Looking at the issue of building--
<BR>
Code offers us a range of forms to write within:
<BR>
 Stored on properties, the texts of a given object work
<BR>
  together in a certain way.
<BR>
 So: player.name, .description, @messages;
<BR>
     room.description, .amb_noise, @messages;
<BR>
     note.text; litter.text; costume.role and role_desc,
<BR>
     etc. etc.
<BR>
Objects function as poetic forms, like sonnets, odes or
<BR>
 epitaphs--the only difference being they are more dynamic or
<BR>
 'interactive'.
<BR>
  (This is just as true of a post to *graffiti--a writable db
<BR>
   object--as it is of a bot.)
<BR>
MOOBuilding = writing within these forms. (Duh.)
<BR>
 Not only $rooms but all our stuff.
<BR>

<BR>
The 'action' of the MOO is merely a more immediate rhetoric, the
<BR>
 medley of our rhetorical performances as we gesture and chat
<BR>
 and play in other ways, layered on top of and mixed with the
<BR>
 rhetoric we perform through the server, the dynamic
<BR>
 publication of our programmed and built text.
<BR>
So good building is not only expressive text; it also helps
<BR>
 bring expressive text into being, by stimulating us to think
<BR>
 and feel a certain way, and so offering rhetorical platforms,
<BR>
 springboards, inspiration for our own performances.
<BR>
(TinyScenery is just building that fails to do this.)
<BR>

<BR>
Which is the real action? What's the most expressive?
<BR>
Maybe all of it.
<BR>
Maybe a slow MOO (as mel suggested) isn't bad.
<BR>
Maybe it's just more carefully considered. It's not just an
<BR>
 endless party. It's not even just a 'community'.
<BR>
It's a collaborative work of textual art, criticism, theory,
<BR>
 textual experience.
<BR>
It's a stage, a scene.
<BR>
Any community is based on that collaboration.
<BR>
Even acknowledging the most apparent activity of a MOO to be a
<BR>
 certain entertaining chattiness, still I think that's not
<BR>
 really why we are here. (We know where to go for that.)
<BR>

<BR>
I guess all this is merely to suggest we think about our
<BR>
building and creating in functional terms (yeah, which everyone
<BR>
seems already to be doing nicely). How is it working? what do
<BR>
we do with it? What kind of contacts come off here? reading,
<BR>
performances. What you will.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe the MOO isn't a space; maybe it's more like a literary
<BR>
anthology, of a more dynamic kind of literature than was ever
<BR>
possible before, created by its own audience, critiqued within
<BR>
its own 'pages' on the fly.
<BR>

<BR>
And if we want more action? We only have to organize it.

Dhalgren froze up and subsequently crashed last night around 9pm last night.  This may not have been the fault of the machine: the net in the building in which it's located became unreachable as well.
<BR>
We rebuilt the kernel to 1.1.67 with NE2000 support.  If this doesn't stabilize things, the next thing might be further work on the kernel driver.
<BR>
Oh, and Bak made it so that the clocktime wouldn't get whacked out anymore, by making it so when the system is rebooted, it queries a time server on the net for an accurate time.

<BR>
We-ell, Dhalgren got totally hosed over the weekend, so we came in to see if it was a problem with the network in the building.  It appears that the problem (or a major problem anyway) was a flaky ethernet junction box that affected not only Dhalgren, but an innocent bystander PC on the same piece of wire.
<BR>
We, um, repaired it with lots of scotch  tape until permanent repairs can be made, and things appear to have entirely stabilized.

Yes, send your comments to *g.  We have been discussing for some time now, a WWW interface to Dhalgren.  Trismegistos has painted a fantastic banner image for our web page, and Bakunin has installed a web server on dhalgren.english.  The ChibaMOO and JHM codes have been discussed.  ChibaMOO is supposed to be quite straightforward, since its done in MOO-code rather than as modifications to the MOO server.

<BR>
Heya,
<BR>

<BR>
leggie mentioned that I should send these ideas here before posting to *g, so, here goes.
<BR>

<BR>
I think that there's a lot of neat things that could be done wrt interfacing the Dhalgren web pages with the MOO.  Now, I don't know how this could be done, but, apparently, it's not too hard to do, as both JHM and Chiba have WWW/MOO interaction.  Here's a short list of ideas, with a more specific, themely suggestion to follow in the next post.
<BR>

<BR>
*  We could have it so outsiders reaching the Web pages can see who are currently connected to the MOO.  This shouldn't be too hard, I'd suspect.
<BR>
*  How about making it so that individual denizens of the MOO can create, say, a kid of a generic HTML object.  One could then @notedit HTML-formatted text onto a prop of the object, put the object in a "web room," and have the text appear on the Web pages.  Now, this could get out of hand, so whatever is allowed in the room would have to be approved by the wizardry, of course.  I think it could be neat, if just as a way for the populace to have a place to show off their characters.
<BR>
*  Put individual rooms (such as, perhaps, the D.E.W.) on the Web.  Maybe there are rooms in which something like this would be more appropriate, rooms in which the decor is less interactive, more showy and where neato gifs of the contents of the room might be neat to show off.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, I have no idea how to do any of this, but I *do* know that there has been stuff done like this before.  I have neither the time nor the knowledge to do this; I'm an idea man.  But, these are presented as barely-formed ideas at this point.  I think the public might have more interesting and outre ideas if they were posted to *g...
<BR>

<BR>
Now, onto the next, more detailed idea.  :-)

<BR>

<BR>
Ok,
<BR>

<BR>
Now, when I first came here, I was drawn to it partially due to the pronouncement that it would be a fun mesh of Delaney, Burroughs and Dick.  The first two have been incorporated pretty well into the MOO, but the third hasn't really been attempted (other than Valis's character and a brief flirt I had with building an Aramchek Blvd.  :-).
<BR>

<BR>
So, what I propose is that we make a "Ubik interface" between the MOO and the Web pages.  (For those who don't know, Ubik deals with the consensual world of a bunch of possibly dead people, under the influence of a strong psychic.  In order to communicate with these people, a spray can of a substance called Ubik is used as a focus, as well as serving as a means to fight off the insane psychic.  That's a really bad summary, read the book.)
<BR>

<BR>
So, blow-by-blow, here are my ideas re: how Ubik could be a nice themely way to interface the pages with this little consensual reality.
<BR>

<BR>
*  Have there be (in-MOO) a Can of Ubik, which serves as something akin to the LambdaMOO/JHM picturephone.  The can stores whatever is being said within its room in a short (10-20 line) buffer... when a person connects to the Ubik page on the Web, one reads the most recent happenings in the room that the can is in.
<BR>

<BR>
*  As added spice to the above idea, have it so that there is a forms interface on the Web pages which allows a curious webber to type in a brief (one-line) message and have it sent to the room that the can is inside.  Of course, this could be an easy tool of harassment, so as guards against such behavior, the Can is moveable by anyone, or is able to be "capped."  Also, perhaps it might be wise to have any announcements by the can (from the Web) tag on a site-info line, letting the denizens in the room know where the webber is connecting from.
<BR>

<BR>
*  Make it so that the webber can utilize a forms interface to move the can of Ubik eirselves.  A restricted list of allowable rooms (D.E.W., The Crossroads, The Lobby of the Labry, etc.) could be chosen from, and, when the form is submitted, the Can would move to wherever the webber wished.  (Of course, in order to relieve rampant fear and paranoia that the web is always peeking over our shoulders, we could also have it so that, perhaps, the Can of Ubik would spray, letting the MOOers know that a webperson connected to the page.)
<BR>

<BR>
I obviously really like this idea, but, as with the previous post, I know not how to do this, or if it's possible.  But, I like how this fits with the communication "between-worlds" within Dick's novel, and think it could be a fun thing.

Subj: Arc's latest ideas
<BR>

<BR>
mrx opines Arc's latest brainstorm is ultra, the Ubik can in most particular.
<BR>

<BR>
It seems the hard thing would be to have an .html property on an
<BR>
object (a room or container object) emend itself on the fly to allow
<BR>
hypertext links to whatever objects/players happen to be inside it
<BR>
with their own active .html props. If that could be done (how does
<BR>
Chiba do it?), I'd think a Ubik can would be feasible. :enterfunc/:exitfunc?
<BR>
(And how have webbed MOOs handled verbs? I guess I should cruise and see....)
<BR>

<BR>
In particular, I have an interest that .html props be more than
<BR>
simple markups of the .description, inasmuch as the calligrammic
<BR>
verse of, say, the O.o.F. Theater, the stage, or Zenith's garden of
<BR>
wildflowers isn't going to make it across to most folks' web browsers
<BR>
(since typically these browsers use Times Roman or another
<BR>
proportionally spaced display font, not a fixed-spacing font like
<BR>
Courier for which this shape poetry is necessarily designed...). HTML
<BR>
does have a tag for fixed-spacing format, doesn't  it? Or we could
<BR>
_paint_ our gardens....
<BR>

<BR>
This project seems like alot of work for someone, but very very cool if
<BR>
done with an eye to the neat kinds of interactive objects Arc is thinking
<BR>
about.... this body can foresee scanning photos from the archives and
<BR>
littering Bellona with them (and you thought it was bad now! ;-).
<BR>

<BR>
This is a great idea; what we need is good programming know-how (Kid?)
<BR>
and, no doubt, that scarcest of riches Time....yah! Marcus

Subj: WWW server stuff
<BR>

<BR>
I've implemented a couple of MOO-WWW servers.  It's very simple, really.  In the simplest form it just means adding a GET verb to the $login object.  The more robust version I use has a separate Perl script that listens to a separate port and forwards the requests onto $login:web.  Then $login:web parses the url and calls the :html verb on an object, which returns a list of strings, containing HTML formatting for that object (often just the description).
<BR>
ASCII art can be done with <pre> and </pre> tags.  I've done that in the Hypertext Hotel, at duke.cs.brown.edu:8888.  Visit there if you haven't already.
<BR>
Other stuff, like processing forms, is a little bit more work.  Forms can be done completely in-db, but it makes it a little bit simpler if some of the encoding translations can be done with a modification to the server.  That's a bit more serious, though.
<BR>
Overall, it's not very hard to do it.  And a MOO makes a really fun WWW server.  If you haven't visited WAXweb, at http://bug.village.virginia.edu:7777, check it out.  It shows how much it's possible to do using a MOO to generate everything dynamically, on the fly.

Any chance of throwing together a little help-script or MOOtorial, demonstrating a simple application of this capability?

Well, the MOO WWW server would be independent from the Dhalgren web page.  So we could keep that server up and have a server on port 8000.  Or we could have the MOO deliver what's up on the Dhalgren page.  Either way would be feasible.  Since the MOO can't deliver binary files, we'd have to have some sort of regular WWW server running so that we can get pictures.  But the text can all get delivered from the MOO.
<BR>
Uh, does that make sense?  It should make more sense once and if it all goes up.

Check out the art collection in avatar -- hundreds of Furries have drawn images of themselves or other players.  There is also a huge collection of (mostly pornographic) furry fiction.  Furry has a strong artistic and imaginative following, and this web page gives a good glimpse into one of the truly distinctive cultures to evolve on line.
<BR>

<BR>
I haven't seen the same kind of true artifact-generating culture in other MUDS.  Maybe we should try making *text and available in an archive from our web page.  It also looks like the Furry folks are starting a project to make a pictorial web tour of the central sites of their MUD.

 It would be neat if, when the topo of the Dhalgren website gets worked out, appropriate hyperlinks were placed in various areas...
<BR>

<BR>
 For example (and working off the list I just posted to *cool), The Rave would take you to a ravers' homepage; Interzone University would contain links to various scholarly resources; the weird building with purple lights would allow you to be mysteriously "abducted" to a randomly chosen fringe/crank/cult website ...
<BR>

This gives more reason for people to explore the WebMoo than if everything were glommed into one place at the outset.

That's a MOOism.  When you log off, a housekeeper (in our case, a gang of thugs) takes you home.  On MUCKs, you stay where you are, but users can always "sweep" a room clear of sleepers, sending them home.
