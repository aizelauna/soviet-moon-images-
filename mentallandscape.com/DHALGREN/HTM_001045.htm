&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn artificial island, built of rocks, chunks of broken concrete, rusted pipes, major appliances, and ancient car parts, covered over with earth.    A palisade of similar construction, topped with metal spikes, broken bottles, and barbed wire, surrounds the island, defending a goatpen and a dilapidated-looking hut.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe wall looks impassable, but there must be a door to the northeast, since you got in that way.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is day and the grey rain has made the ground muddy.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A ramshackle hut made of whatever was around.

You duck under the goatskin door flap and enter the hut.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the northeast, a section of the wall appears to be hinged as a door to the outside.

You open a door in the wall to the northeast and slip through to the outside, closing it behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A rough but sturdily built roofed enclosure, scattered with hay, straw, food scraps, and goat droppings.

You head into the goat pen, against the advice of your nose.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a goat bleating somewhere.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the water lapping at the edges of the island.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA seagull flies by, shrieking.
