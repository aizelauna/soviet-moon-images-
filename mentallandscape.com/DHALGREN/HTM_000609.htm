&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour footsteps echo in the cavernous depot.  Thick walls and vaulted ceiling of granite once produced high radon levels, before the windows were broken.  Stone floor and wooden benches polished smooth by countless travelers.  To the east, through a large open archway, a bus is parked.  It doesn't look like it's running, but somehow its open door seems to invite you to board.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a Bellona: Bus Depot on the floor.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a set of revolving doors leading out to broadway.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000206.htm">Loading Porch</A>.
You step through the broken revolving doors onto the street.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000606.htm">Interzone: Port Of Saints</A>.
You get on the bus and are surprised to see it's running.  The doors close and you sit down.  You feel a strange and powerful euphoria overtake you and you pass out for a moment.  You seem to awaken moments later, no longer on the bus.
