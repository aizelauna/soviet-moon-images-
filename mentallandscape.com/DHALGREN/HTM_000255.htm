&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are in the opulant chambers of the Master of the Chantry. The room glows of its own mystical power. The walls are hidden behind curtains of purple velvet, and the thick carpeting is a creamy colour. The large, four poster bed is floating in a cloud of velvet and satin, cream and royal purple in hue. Candles burn throughout the room, on stands and in holders, giving the room a feeling of living light.
