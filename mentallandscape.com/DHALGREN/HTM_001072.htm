&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on the site of Bellona 500 million years ago, the shore of the sea.  The air is breathable now, but a little thin.  Behind you, desolate volcanic rock stretches as far as the eye can see.  But before you is a tidal pool teaming with plants and animals.  You stare in fascination at a variety of small creatures in the shallow pool -- most are totally unfamiliar and bizarre looking bugs.  You notice a large worm with five eyes and a single clawed arm extending in front.  You recognize a few trilobites with their large compound eyes, looking almost like wrap-around sunglasses.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou look around and once again notice the word "next" chiseled in stone.
