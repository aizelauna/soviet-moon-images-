&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are at the southern end of a long vaulted cavern; the northern end is lost in the darkness.  A pool of cool bluish water two or three feet deep is filled with baroque limestone formations and  white, eyeless fish.  A hemp rope is tied around a stalagmite and drops into a hole in the floor.  The rock ledge you stand on runs north along side the shallow pool.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe signs here will explain how players can communicate.

You scramble over the lip of the whole and down the rope, knot by knot.  You notice the end of the rope seems oddly frayed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The rock ledge continues north.

You walk north along the ledge.  A sound of rushing water becomes louder and louder as you proceed.
