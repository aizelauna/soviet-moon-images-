&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspStanding in the doorway, you notice the sweetest of aromas wafting out towards you. You struggle to put your finger on what exactly it is, but you cannot. You know only it is one that sparks a lovely memory out of your past, and you are overwhelmed with the desire to go in. Entering, you notice that something peculiar happened to the walls and interior...you could swear you saw the tiniest shift, something about the shape and design... but then you shake your head and conclue you are i imaginging things as you find yourself in the room of your dreams.
