&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll streets of the City slope down between deepening canyons to a vast, kidney-shaped plaza.  Walls of street and plaza are perforated by dwelling cubicles and cafes, some a few feet deep, others extending out of sight in a network of rooms and corridors  At all levels criss-cross of bridges, cat walks, cable cars.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFollowers of obsolete unthinkable trades, doodling in Etruscan, addicts of drugs not yet synthesized, black marketeers of World War III, excisors of telepathic sensitivity, osteopaths of the spirit, officials of unconstituted police states, drinkers of the Heavy Fluid sealed in translucent amber of dreams.

You drift out of the Plaza, through a hungry group of reptiles.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A street winds its way down to the port.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ northeast ] <A HREF="HTM_000947.htm">Dr Benway's Clinic</A>.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A narrow alley wanders away to the northwest, mingling the scents of a hundred spices. Like an invisible hand, the dark allure of contraband chocolate beckons beneath that aromatic veil.
[ nw ] <A HREF="HTM_000584.htm">Morte Delizioso</A>.
Seized by an irresistible impulse, you move across the Plaza. A snake charmer plays upon his flute while a cobra rises and sways, a sinuous sentinel guarding the entrance to the spice sellers' alleyway. You travel a crooked chiaroscuro maze, barely aware of your surroundings until you find the archway you seek. Beyond it is a vine covered courtyard with a small marble fountain. Here is the shop, small, unobtrusive, its secret delights known only to the initiate. Opening the door, you step inside. Instantly you are drenched in fragrance...rich, dark, intoxicating. Cioccolato.
