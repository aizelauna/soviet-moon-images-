&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can't describe this place since it's everchanging. You are in the middle of the Primal Chaos. You are surprised that the Chaos does not destroy you. The place is perfectly silent except for noise made by you or any other being around, that gives the place a surrealistic touch. In the middle of that Chaos stands a piece of Order. It has taken the form of 21" monitor with a keyboard and a mouse linked to it.
