&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe pavement is shattered into large tilted slabs of rain-soaked asphalt.  Daylight retakes the street from the six street lamps -- two with broken globes.  No lights in any near buildings; but along the waterfront, beyond veils of smoke, you think you see fire.  To the west, the pylons of the bridge frame the last remaining exit from Bellona.  Across the street, to the east, you see a narrow alley.  The street continues north and south.

EXITS:

You walk onto the bridge, heading west.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Across the street you see a narrow alley between two brick buildings.

You cross the street and duck into the alley.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look north along Broadway's trash-covered streets and ruined buildings.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_000206.htm">Loading Porch</A>.
You walk north several blocks, keeping an eye out doorways to duck into.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Across an unbroken expanse of water, you can see a well-defended heap of rubble.

You place possibly unfounded faith in the presence of an invisible bridge, and step off the shore to the southwest.
