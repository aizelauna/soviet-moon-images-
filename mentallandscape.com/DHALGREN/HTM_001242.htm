(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000004.htm">generic builder</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001242.htm">Roderick</A>)

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTall, fair skinned, with dark hair.  You notice a quiet, steady look in his dark green eyes.  Nothing spectacular, but enough to notice.  Of average attractiveness, Roderick looks as if he'd rather observe life in a laboratory than live it.  He's a fairly social person, however.  Only fairly.
