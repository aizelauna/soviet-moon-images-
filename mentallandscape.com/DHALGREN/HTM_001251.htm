&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHigh in the sky at about thirty-five degrees
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMighty Jupiter shines brightly,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith his garland of moons.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom afar a silver shower comes down,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJupiter raining on Jupiter--
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll things turned over!
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe morning breaks in a glory,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA string of pearls.
