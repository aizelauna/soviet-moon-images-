&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA young woman, barely into her twenties, more interesting looking than pretty. Her coppery hair and blue eyes are nice, though. She's wearing a work shirt that's starting to fray at cuffs and collar, jeans, and tall boots that lace up the sides with green leather thongs. From time to time, she blows a riff on a Hohner E blues harp and smiles at you over the silvery notes.
