&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA vast parking lot. Hundreds of cars bearing license plates from all over the region sit squarely in neat rows. Most of their windshields are smashed, and broken glass crunches under your feet as you walk. Several Greyhound buses, sprayed with illegible graffiti, are parked along the periphery of the lot. To the north you see a high wrought-iron fence with a gated archway. The iron letters twisted into the gate's grillwork read BELLONA ZOOLOGICAL GARDENS.
