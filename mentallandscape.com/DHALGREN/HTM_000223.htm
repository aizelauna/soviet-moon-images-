&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBrambles coil the trellis.  Dried tendrils curl on splintered lathe.  The ground is gouged up in black confusion here and there.  A statue of Perseus, arms and genitals broken off, stands in a ten-foot dish of stone overflowing with rain water.  A path leads to the east through a hedge.  To the north is a vine-covered gate.
