&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOtherwise naked, this futuristic re-incarnation of the ancient Russian mystic from Tyumn is cloaked in a heavy grey tunic.  His hair is mussed, long and dark brown falling in a resplendent mane upon his shoulders.  His gaze reflects two piercing, azure and amused eyes.  He seems detached, but is not hostile or thoughtless.  About his neck near his heart hangs a polished amber sarcophagus with a  spider entombed within- it's legs bleached white from antiquity and the ancient Baltic sun . . .
