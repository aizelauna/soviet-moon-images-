<H3> Saffron (#510)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000510.htm">Saffron</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOddly different here, yet the same. Still swung out, oddly ripped,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspjumped badly and dented from too much time spend in other worlds.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSaffron's skin is pale, clear cream, her eyes black like packet
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsploss. Lost tangles of hair down her back, brown, recursive.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe's only a symbol, but terribly affected by the moon.
