&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou know immediately it is the Devil.  He sits in his chair laughing
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand  typing furiously.  His bony knees propped up like locust legs,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphis naked skin  glowing a greenish white.  You smile as you  notice
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat he has no horns or  cleft foot.  Although you are not a good
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspChristian, it surprises you that the  Devil, of all people, has a
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcharacter on Dhalgren.  He must seek out those he  thinks he can
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspimpress.
