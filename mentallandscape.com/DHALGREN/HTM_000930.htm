<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mass of unpleasantly blue sugar fluff.
</pre>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp... You see Jim Rose dancing on the head of a pin.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  You see Fakir Musafar french-kissing Marilyn Quayle.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  The Dying Moon Carnival of days gone by whirls in front of your eyes,  flashing brilliant colors and glittering lights.  
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  You suddenly understand Judith Butler.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  You see Dream Date Barbie, life-size and insane, running at you with a  chainsaw.  
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...  You see the Devil in a golden tuxedo.  You dance a jig with her.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp... Like the edges of a dream during the waking state, tattooing showed the  sailor that dreams are made actual through pain.  
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp... You crush grapes in clusters with your toes.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp... Moreover, since the I who desired and the eye who perceived had nothing  to do with each other and at the same time existed in the same body - mine:   I was not possible.  
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Girls will be boys and boys will be girls.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The sea is black with robots' blood.
