<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a wearable object, but with a twist...
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMarkup strings It's a crescent moon, and  waxing. may be included in its @worn message. 
If the player wearing the object is a child of #1223 (the generic lycanthrope), messages 
from the set @full_moon, @new_moon, @gibbous_moon, @half_moon, @crescent_moon, @moon_waxing 
and @moon_waning will be substituted for these strings according to the present phase 
of the moon, thus phasing the @worn message. See 'help messages' for help on how 
to set these.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe moon, for players who don't know, is #932 in Dhalgren...(its phases correspond 
to actual phases of the earth's largest satellite).
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf the player wearing the object is not a descendent of the lycanthrope (#1223), 
the object will look kind of funny.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFor more help on marking up descriptions (or in this case the @worn message), see 
#110, the Post-Apocalyptic Room, which performs similar substitutions for weather 
and daytime...
