HELP MANUAL:

<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Generic Scripted Object is a simple toy.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDescendents of it have a property, .script, a list of lines to be played to the room.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@notedit <object>.script to write your script.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lag between lines may be changed with @setdelay <object> to <delay>. (The default 
setting is 4).
