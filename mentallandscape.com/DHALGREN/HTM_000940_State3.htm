<H3>Tattooed Lady (#940): sexy</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJingling your coins in her left hand, the Tattooed Lady looks you over appraisingly. She apparently likes what she sees...the fury in her eyes has given way to a smoldering come-hither gaze, and she runs her tongue seductively over her lower lip (which, you notice, reads 'syb-a-rite: n. a person devoted to pleasure and luxury; voluptuary. [Lat. Sybaria, native of Sybaris <Gk. Subarites <Subaris, Sybaris, Italy (from the notorious luxury of the inhabitants of Sybaris).]'). She leans forward and begins to whisper huskily in your ear...at which point you decide that maybe you'd better just ignore her.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000940_State4.htm">ignore</A> ] ignores the Tattooed Lady. Disappointed, the Tattooed Lady shrugs philosophically and yawns.
