&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see standing before you, a slender, lovely, graceful figure. She nods quietly in your direction acknowlegding your presents and gaze. When you notice her intense blue eyes. The colour of untouched pools of water in a undistured forest. Her light shinny amber hair hangs loss about her shoulders. Dressed in forest green robes with a leather belt hanging loss around her waist. Her long elagant fingers hold a 3 quarter staff at her side. You notice the unusal gold, silver, and bronze woven bracelet on her left wrist. She appears tobe at rest, from the great quest that directs her life.
