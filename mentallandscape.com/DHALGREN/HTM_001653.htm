&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a huge glass-enclosed atrium that goes all the way up the building between the two towers. Glass catwalks cross between the two towers, and lighted glass elevators make their way up inside the atrium like beads. The bottom level is covered with tubs of plants, winding paths, and a fountain. There is a niche with a bench tucked away in it nearly hidden among some large fern trees.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There is a large lobby filled with talking fans to the south.

You step around the two SCA swordsmen engaged in a live steel demonstration and enter the lobby.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp East leads under a glass archway into the Main Convention Hall.

You pass east under the archway and find yourself in a large, bustling convention hall jam packed with fans.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp West is what every trufan wants: a hot tub! Also a swimming pool and a nice sunny patio.

You step out onto the sunny patio.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp To the north is the Registration desk and the North Tower.

You thread your way among the paths between the potted plants.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Vaguely tropical plants thrive in the bright atrium.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This is an abstract fountain tucked away among some trailing grape ivy. Through six inches of water you can see lots of pennies and someone's autographed TARDIS key. Little origami cranes and boats float on the water, as well as on occasional paper airplane. Water trickles down from the top out of what suspiciously resembles lion heads but... You aren't quite sure.
