&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on a wide gravel driveway surrounded by shaggy pine trees, branches drip with rainwater.  To the north is an imposing mansion of brick and white columns.  You are amazed that none of its windows are broken.  To the southeast is a brass gate leading to the street.  To the west, you see a path leading through an opening in a hedge.
