&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you typed "look caveman", you saw how another player might appear.  To look at 
yourself, type "look me".  All objects, including players, have a DESCRIPTION which 
can be set with the "@describe" command.  In addition to a description, players have 
a GENDER, which can be set with the "@gender" command.  For example, the caveman 
here must have typed:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @gender male
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @describe me as "You see a short, stout man ...
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe description is a single long line, which will be displayed as a paragraph.  For 
more complex descriptions, see 'help @notedit'.
