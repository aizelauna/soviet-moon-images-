&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA huge man stands before you. He wears around his muscular neck the medals of Regattas long since forgotten. His short cropped hair has gone grey, and the bulging muscles seem as if they long for the dayswhen they were once challenged by competion. The shirt and shorts he wear are stained with the sweatof years pulling an oar. You notice his hands, powerfully knuckled and calloused, are permanently cupped to the shape of his oar handle. His dark eyes burn with desire and power, but without purpose:empty and almost bitter.
