<BR>

<BR>
I did a shutdown and restart of Dhalgren.  The long pause on login is gone now.  Also, the moo process is 4 Mbytes smaller than it used to be!  A local guru here says that malloc gets "quadratically slow" when it runs for a long time, freeing and allocating memory.  I might try recompiling the moo with SGI's improved malloc, which is not supposed to do that.  Let's wait and see if things get laggy again.

<BR>

<BR>
It occurs to me that this place could get fairly popular fairly quickly, as the friends we'd like to invite themselves constitute a fairly sizeable population.
<BR>
So I was thinking we should maybe discuss administrative policy, like who gets programmer bits, who gets quota, who gets to build, where and how and all that stuff.

Subj: Player Creations/Requests
<BR>

<BR>
Okay. Creation of new characters at the login screen is now disabled.
<BR>

<BR>
We have created 6 guests (You can see who by doing @kids $guest).
<BR>

<BR>
I've set up the mailing list *Player_Requests that only we can read, and that guests can send to.
<BR>

<BR>
When a guest logs in and types: @request name for email-address, a message is automatically sent to this mail-list.
<BR>

<BR>
I recommend that all of us wizzes read this mail-list. I also recommand that all wizzes read *Player-Creation-Log. The easiest way to do this is to just @read last on #19 and you'll be subscribed from then on. Using @nn or something to read it with.
<BR>

<BR>
This way, when a request pops up on *player-requests, any wiz will see it and be able to check *player-creation-log to see if that char has been made already. If not, s/he can do so if s/he chooses. 
<BR>

<BR>
I'd say we wait a day or two from the time the request pops up to let all wizzes have a chance to see it and possibly object to it. We can also mail to *Player-Requests, so I think any objections should be stated there, not on *wiz.
<BR>

<BR>
Anything else? We could even set stuff up like on Lambda. A board guests can look at and see how their request for a char is doing. But that may be too fancy for our needs.
<BR>

<BR>
Also, I think it's important from now on that we keep track of email-addresses. There are too many players right now who just don't have one registered. I'm sure people have bunches of characters already.
<BR>

<BR>
Maybe we should think about doing 2nd character registration...

I ask now because some of the code I ported required that I have a help entry somewhere about it. To be displayed to people who log in as a guest and type @request when they have a char already.

To help keep track of player requests, I've made the Player Requets Board #426.
<BR>

<BR>
To see pending requests, type: summary #426
<BR>

<BR>
Since I tried to fit a lot of info on the screen at once, it's likely that some of it got cut off. To see the full information on a request type:
<BR>

<BR>
see # on #426 , where # is the number from summary.
<BR>

<BR>
The board lives in the Mayor's office #186. I'll probably be adding to it here and there. I whipped it up pretty fast.

I've invited some research people and friends who have not MOOed before, and they have given some good feedback.
<BR>
First, the mail that @make-player sends tells people to type @tutorial.  We should replace that with some comment about the caves to the west of the river banks.
<BR>
Also, its directions to Dhalgren need to be specific, most people don't know how to connect to an address and port number.  We should say explicityly "telent actinic.princeton.edu 7777   -or- use a client if you have one".
<BR>
Can we make @wrap ON be default?  These new guys log on and just can't read anything.  I put a comment in the newspaper, but they don't know they should type "news".

I bring this up because Ignatz #455 and Jafaar #458 are both Blackbriar. I recognized both of his email addresses in the *Player-Creation-Log. They are completely separate addresses, but both his...

The server is growing.  Let's cool it on quota increases.  I'd say 51K is an upper limit except for major exceptions that we discuss.  If friends or someone doing something cool runs out of 25K, bump them up to 50.
<BR>
I don't mean to be a hard ass, but Dhalgren just has to stay lean and mean, unless I get more RAM for my Indy.  I think it will be a better MOO if people focus on quality and not quantity anyway.

He restructured "South Broadway" and instead of recycling the old exits, he changed them to $things.  I still have not been able to repaire the damage -- this is not his fault -- but @rose will not work there.  I removed the bogus exits from the exit lists and entrance lists, but some data structure is still really messed up.  Kinda interesting really.

Subj: Grim Reaper
<BR>

<BR>
I believe the Grim Reaper is ready. I've put a bunch of upkeep type of verbs on him:
<BR>

<BR>
@goners from Grim => Just shows you a list of players who haven't logged in lately. Broken down by month. Also, has a flag for those who don't have descriptions and those who own objects. A periodic task that runs weekly goes through and updates this list.
<BR>

<BR>
@check-email with Grim => Runs through all players and tells you whose email is screwed up and how.
<BR>

<BR>
@reap <player> with Grim => The actual reaping verb. Before actually doing anything, it checks to see if the player shows up in the @goners list. Checks to see if it owns anything. Along the way it asks you several times if you want to continue. So you can abort just in case. Finally, it does the actual recycling and resetting of $player_db, $registration_db, and the players owned objects if there are any. Those objects are @chowned to $hacker and a list of them is kept on the Grim Reaper so you can dole them out to other people.
<BR>

<BR>
Probably, it's a lot better to take care of owned objects before reaping, but just in case you forget or are lazy, this will do it for you to a certain extent.
<BR>

<BR>
I haven't tested the reap verb yet. Patro? You had some you wanted to try. Lets get together online and test the verb with those players.

We're starting to become well known.  Let's lower the initial quota to 12 or 15K.  I perused some of the new players, and it seems to take 6 or 8K for people to have a player and a several rooms and things.
<BR>

<BR>
Then I'd suggest a quota policy like this: If someone builds something cool, give them 25K.  If the build more cool stuff, give them 50K.  More than that, ask me about it.

We should try to check for writable wiz verbs.  I'd also like to take this opportunity to ask wizards not to build as wizards, so we can keep down the potentially dangerous presence of wized verbs.  I carry the UNIX philosophy into MOOs which is wized (i.e. "suid") verbs are bad.  They should be used only as the last resort to accomplish a task.

As for programming as wizards, Patro is right. I know I hardly ever log on as Dred, but I always program verbs permed to him. Very few wizard verbs and only then when I know for sure they aren't insecure. I know the permissions systems pretty well. Have no fear.

No reason to turn it off at all. Only wizards can open network connections.
<BR>

<BR>
On $network, all the verbs are well protected. The only time a non-wizard can make a $network:open call is when they are in $network.trusts.

Subj: prog bits
<BR>

<BR>
I'm wondering what our policy about prog bits should be.  Experience on Furry seems to be that preventing anti-social programming is important.  Antisocial speach and behavior seems to just result in players being ignored and shunned.  But programming allows jerks to amplify their hostility or need for attention with easy-to-use verbs for humiliating people, spamming them, or performing automatic rape too fast for the victim to avoid.  Lambda and PMC seems to be evidance that unrestricted programming undermines a MUD.  Furry goes too far in theother direction, no program can be compiled without wizard inspection.
<BR>

<BR>
A suggestion might be, don't give prog bits to strangers without asking them what they want to do.  Make it clear that antisocial programming will not be allowed (spamming, fart verbs, verbs that enforce involuntary "actions" on other players via spoofing).

Hmm. I suppose we can screen strangers a little bit about giving out a prog bit to them. But I'd rather go ahead and just give it to them if they have good ideas and give them the benefit of the doubt.
<BR>

<BR>
I'd really hate to make a clique-ish atmosphere like JHM. Where you have to know someone in order to get a bit. 
<BR>

<BR>
One thing about Lambda is that it's really really squeamish about taking away prog bits from players who cause problems. People consider prog bits a right there. Not a privilege.
<BR>

<BR>
If we just simply revoke bits from players who write such verbs that you are worrying about, I don't see how things can get out of hand. 
<BR>
So why not give them out if we adopt such an attitude?

Subj: quota and programming policy
<BR>

<BR>
We've had a few discussions about policy and I've thought some about this.  Let me make a couple quick comments to clarify the situation with quota and prog bits.
<BR>

<BR>
Dhalgren runs on a very fast machine (the MIPS R4400 is faster than LambdaMOO's CPU), but one that has relatively little RAM (32 megabytes).  For the time being we hope to keep the database down below 5 or 6 meg.  Its 2.7 meg now.  Players start out with 25K, which is enough to build a number of rooms and toys.  We hope people will concentrate on making a few quality things rather than a lot of scenery.  Any wizard can give you 50K if they like what you do, and more than 50 is possible with some inter-wizard discussion.
<BR>

<BR>
Prob bits are given out pretty freely.  Unlike LambdaMOO and PostModernCulture, we do not allow anti-social verbs here.  We encourage free artistic expression, but this does not include programs designed to attack or annoy players.  Sexual harassment is a toadable offense.  Spamming people, making them fart or vomit or other such action spoofs will get prog bits turned off.  Creating provocative objects is OK.  A player can go into a museum and see a Maplethorp picture and get pissed off -- but he can't go in a museum and have something out of a malplethorp picture HAPPEN to him.
<BR>

<BR>
Well, this isn't written by a lawyer, so I hope the intension is clear.  The difference between "provocative" and "hostile" is subjective, and since we have really had no problems yet, let's just leave it at this for now.

We have a blank help property, #104.mulitple-characters that needs to be filled with text about our policy.
<BR>

<BR>
And when such a 2nd character is created, remember to `@second <player2> to <player1>.
<BR>

<BR>
Anyone want to volunteer to write the help? Well, I suppose we should decide on policy first. heh. 
<BR>

<BR>
I would suggest that we make them no problem, but bring their quota down to 0. Registered characters will share quota. So it will all come out of the original player's quota. Not a problem as far as I can see.

I'm not sure about the login lag, except to perhaps wonder about the portmapping routines. The handoff from unix to the MOO. I'm not sure though.
<BR>

<BR>
As for the ip address, it is definitely a problem with the name server. I would suspect, though, that it is simply that the machine which holds the name server is the problem, or the connection from your machine to it. Not anything wrong with your machine specifically. It's a common problem. One I experience frequently at my system.

@request isn't broken. It just does several checks to make sure that everything is kosher before doing the request. If it isn't, it won't do the request and tells the player to send email so a wiz can do it and figure out what's what.
<BR>

<BR>
It didn't work for you Patro because you weren't connecting from rufous.yorku.ca or anything remotely similar. Probably, for Chaos, it was that Dhalgren couldn't figure out what site he was connecting from. It should have told him exactly why.

Subj: @measure breakdown
<BR>

<BR>
when using `@measure breakdown <obj>' i always get `permission denied' (twice when not getting the results by mail) because #98:@measure is owned by Quota, so $quota_utils:do_breakdown is called with Quota's perms, which fails the :can_peek check in line 3 of :do_breakdown.

Legba has been urging me to set some guidelines on our various wiz responsibilites.  I don't want to create a highly formal system tho.  My RL responsicilibites drag me away from Dhalgren at times, but there are things I have a special interest in.
<BR>

<BR>
I'm particularly interested in the generic object hierarchy, to push people to experiment, give us some distinctive "look and feel", and keep it consistant.  I should take charge of this since it needs some centralized planning.  We have some minor problems already, not because anthing is done wrong, but  because things are not as consistant as they should be.  The look_self and description() verbs up and down the room heirarchy needs to be rearranged a tiny bit, etc.
<BR>

<BR>
I am very happy that Dred is managing the core.  We are lucky, and in fact I don't think any other MOO has done as nice a job of keeping up with LMOO, and in fact doing better that LMOO since Dred exercises wide judgement about taking and modifying and enhancing the LMOO core.
<BR>

<BR>
Legba has been dealing with quota and player manners and such things.  I don't know if she is happy with that job, but it is pretty much hers now.  As always, we need to keep a lid on quota, encourage quality vs. quantity of building.  I think 100K is a pretty hard ceiling on quota.  The only two exceptions I have been making to that are Marcus and Melusina.
<BR>

<BR>
What do you think about all this?  These are comments, not rules.

I'm hereby formally requesting a programmer's bit.  My goals and intended projects which cannot be done without a progbit:
<BR>
*  Wearable bots, similar to El's Breast Implants.
<BR>
*  Wearable rooms or exits.
<BR>
*  Other combinations of existing object classes.
<BR>

<BR>
This is the last that I will ask for a progbit.  Either you give me one or you don't.  It's my belief that any argument against giving me one is problematic and paranoid, indicating a desire for retribution rather than a desire to foster interesting projects on the MOO.  Thank you.

Subj: Progbits
<BR>

<BR>
Dhalgren is more than an environment to support interesting programming.  It's a small community made up of people who constantly interact with each other while contributing creatively.  Everyone who has decided to spend any amount of time here has put a great deal of work and energy into building and maintaining a fun space.
<BR>
Along with the privilege that comes with having a progbit comes an assumption that the people to whom they are given can be trusted not to do damage with it.  Unlike Lambda, which has become somewhat uninhabitable largely due to the fact that not everyone given the ability to program is required to behave with it in a socially responsible manner, everyone who wants to contribute here _must_ maintain that sense of responsibility.  It's too small a place to survive otherwise.
<BR>
When you went through your last recycling fit, Sean, besides the fact that you behaved in an abysmal manner, for which you admittedly apologized (and your apology is accepted), you behaved irresponsibly.  You recycled your character without bothering first to recycle the many things you'd built.  It took Dred the better part of a day to clean up after you.  It certainly wasn't how he wanted to spend his time.  But he, like the rest of us who spend a lot of our time and energy caring for and maintaining this place, _did_ take the responsibility for your mess.  I don't know if you've ever acknowledged his efforts.  I took the responsibility of saving your character if you ever wanted it back, making sure you knew that you were welcome back here when you cooled off, and making sure that the players toward whom you vented whatever it was that was bothering you had a way to tune you out if they wanted to without doing you the violence of @booting you and @blacklisting your site--which action was frankly far more interventionist than I ever feel like being again.
<BR>
I told you that I would give you a bit on the third of December, and I will keep my word.  but demanding that we restore a privilege that you abused while making minimal effort yourself to regain the trust that we had in you, or even apparently realizing that this would be a desirable step on your part, does not exactly inspire confidence.
<BR>
It is not the responsibility of the people who work hard to maintain Dhalgren to provide a programming environment for you.  It is your responsibility to contribute responsibly, to behave responsibly, and at this point to prove to us that you can.  That is why you are being made to wait.
<BR>
We consider you a member of this community, and I consider you a good friend.  I'm requesting of you that you show more responsibility toward this community and toward your friends than your recent behavior has shown, and not immediately restoring your programming privileges on request is the best means I have of impressing on you the seriousness with which I take this request.

Casanova is a player with a prog bit.  For some reason his parent is generic programmer.  He's missing #99 and #153 verbs.  Furthermore, he claims that @chparent refuses to change his parent and instead gives a warning message like 'You really don't want to do this'
<BR>

<BR>
That's very fucked up.  Players should be switched to #153 automatically when they are given a prog bit.  And even fi they are not a programmer, they should be able to chparent to any PC they want to.

Well guys. It seems that I made a mistake. I should not have changed #176's parent over to your generic integrating room #459.
<BR>

<BR>
When I chparented it over, I had forgotten that there were several experimental projects being conducted along the room and player class tree. By grandly changing the very top of the tree, I messed that up.
<BR>

<BR>
We've talked it over and it has been decided that I should change it back.
<BR>

<BR>
I know you will probably be pretty pissed about this. There's not much I can do about that except to apologize for this mess.  You're quite free to @chparent #459 to #176 and try to talk the owners of the rooms below there to slip you into the tree again.

Please don't take this as any kind of insult against your building. It isn't at all. Your building has always been top notch. We just can't have it at the top of the tree as we initially thought.

Hmm. I also put Sick in $wiz_utils.programmer_restricted, so he can't be re-programmered accidently. (I'll port over the new $wiz:@deprog so we can do this sort of stuff easily)
<BR>

<BR>
So now the question is, will this be a permanent condition? I really don't want to punish him forever. I agree that the way he tested the bug was with a blatant disregard towards the MOO. But, he really didn't know for sure that what he did was the cause of the crash. It could have been a coincidence for all he knew. But by just trying it again without even considering that it might actually be successful, he showed merely a lack of foresight and consideration.
<BR>

<BR>
I say we give back his prog bit after a while. He certainly isn't malicious, just un-thinking. And he is a damn good programmer. If we keep his bit away for too long, then he, and probably Eclipse, will just not come here anymore.

Subj: crash
<BR>

<BR>
as you should know, i did not crash dhalgren as an experiment. rather, a section of code i was testing triggered a server bug which resulted in a crash.
<BR>
 
<BR>
i am terribly sorry for the crash and the resulting loss of time and work.
<BR>
 
<BR>
for those who have not heard, the server bug is only triggered when an assignment is given to a list range [1..$maxint] (ie, `a[1..$maxint]={}'). when using the alist[m..n] syntax, all other combinations for m and n are harmless and work as expected. only a server bug in handling [1..$maxint] triggers the server panic. so you have little to worry about common programming practices activating the error. and, knowing the dangers, those of us who regularly use alist[m..n] assignments can easily avoid that combination.
<BR>
 
<BR>
again, i apologize for the problems this triggered.
<BR>
 
<BR>
understanding the situation, i hope the wizards will feel it safe to restore my programmer bit here.

That should be the ONLY time anyone needs to log in as delany.

<BR>
I'm not at all comfortable dolling out patronizing punisments to players.  I don't think Arc will learn a lesson from being @newted for a few weeks, anymore than he did from the other two punishments we gave him.  He just resents it.  its not our job to be a sheparding government or parent.  I am inclined to try to live with people, but if they make other people unhappy or undermine our work, then they should be @toaded and sitelocked.  Arc has personal problems, and I think there is nothing we can do to help him.

I just tested the network maildrop by using @netforward. I received the mail no problemo.
<BR>

<BR>
Unless the @request verb itself is screwed up, I would suspect that people are mistyping email addresses. A common problem. yduJ is constantly having to fix email addresses for player requests on Lambda. It wouldn't be surprising to encounter the same sort of thing here..

<BR>
So to try and deal with the Great Freeze (could be one of the suns burning out, but...) we upgraded the kernel to v. 1.1.59. 
<BR>
If the problem continues, we'll swap the card for a 16-bit NE2000.
<BR>
There doesn't seem to be shared memory options on either the ethernet card or in the bios.
<BR>
If that doesn't work, we can try a sharp blow with a hammer.

Dhalgren froze up and subsequently crashed last night around 9pm last night.  This may not have been the fault of the machine: the net in the building in which it's located became unreachable as well.
<BR>
We rebuilt the kernel to 1.1.67 with NE2000 support.  If this doesn't stabilize things, the next thing might be further work on the kernel driver.
<BR>
Oh, and Bak made it so that the clocktime wouldn't get whacked out anymore, by making it so when the system is rebooted, it queries a time server on the net for an accurate time.

Subj: Proposal #1
<BR>

<BR>
Heya,
<BR>

<BR>
leggie mentioned that I should send these ideas here before posting to *g, so, here goes.
<BR>

<BR>
I think that there's a lot of neat things that could be done wrt interfacing the Dhalgren web pages with the MOO.  Now, I don't know how this could be done, but, apparently, it's not too hard to do, as both JHM and Chiba have WWW/MOO interaction.  Here's a short list of ideas, with a more specific, themely suggestion to follow in the next post.
<BR>

<BR>
*  We could have it so outsiders reaching the Web pages can see who are currently connected to the MOO.  This shouldn't be too hard, I'd suspect.
<BR>
*  How about making it so that individual denizens of the MOO can create, say, a kid of a generic HTML object.  One could then @notedit HTML-formatted text onto a prop of the object, put the object in a "web room," and have the text appear on the Web pages.  Now, this could get out of hand, so whatever is allowed in the room would have to be approved by the wizardry, of course.  I think it could be neat, if just as a way for the populace to have a place to show off their characters.
<BR>
*  Put individual rooms (such as, perhaps, the D.E.W.) on the Web.  Maybe there are rooms in which something like this would be more appropriate, rooms in which the decor is less interactive, more showy and where neato gifs of the contents of the room might be neat to show off.
<BR>

<BR>
Now, I have no idea how to do any of this, but I *do* know that there has been stuff done like this before.  I have neither the time nor the knowledge to do this; I'm an idea man.  But, these are presented as barely-formed ideas at this point.  I think the public might have more interesting and outre ideas if they were posted to *g...
<BR>

<BR>
Now, onto the next, more detailed idea.  :-)

Subj: Proposal #2
<BR>

<BR>
Ok,
<BR>

<BR>
Now, when I first came here, I was drawn to it partially due to the pronouncement that it would be a fun mesh of Delaney, Burroughs and Dick.  The first two have been incorporated pretty well into the MOO, but the third hasn't really been attempted (other than Valis's character and a brief flirt I had with building an Aramchek Blvd.  :-).
<BR>

<BR>
So, what I propose is that we make a "Ubik interface" between the MOO and the Web pages.  (For those who don't know, Ubik deals with the consensual world of a bunch of possibly dead people, under the influence of a strong psychic.  In order to communicate with these people, a spray can of a substance called Ubik is used as a focus, as well as serving as a means to fight off the insane psychic.  That's a really bad summary, read the book.)
<BR>

<BR>
So, blow-by-blow, here are my ideas re: how Ubik could be a nice themely way to interface the pages with this little consensual reality.
<BR>

<BR>
*  Have there be (in-MOO) a Can of Ubik, which serves as something akin to the LambdaMOO/JHM picturephone.  The can stores whatever is being said within its room in a short (10-20 line) buffer... when a person connects to the Ubik page on the Web, one reads the most recent happenings in the room that the can is in.
<BR>

<BR>
*  As added spice to the above idea, have it so that there is a forms interface on the Web pages which allows a curious webber to type in a brief (one-line) message and have it sent to the room that the can is inside.  Of course, this could be an easy tool of harassment, so as guards against such behavior, the Can is moveable by anyone, or is able to be "capped."  Also, perhaps it might be wise to have any announcements by the can (from the Web) tag on a site-info line, letting the denizens in the room know where the webber is connecting from.
<BR>

<BR>
*  Make it so that the webber can utilize a forms interface to move the can of Ubik eirselves.  A restricted list of allowable rooms (D.E.W., The Crossroads, The Lobby of the Labry, etc.) could be chosen from, and, when the form is submitted, the Can would move to wherever the webber wished.  (Of course, in order to relieve rampant fear and paranoia that the web is always peeking over our shoulders, we could also have it so that, perhaps, the Can of Ubik would spray, letting the MOOers know that a webperson connected to the page.)
<BR>

<BR>
I obviously really like this idea, but, as with the previous post, I know not how to do this, or if it's possible.  But, I like how this fits with the communication "between-worlds" within Dick's novel, and think it could be a fun thing.

Okay. I just spent an hour or so talking with Kidd about the web stuff. He showed me around his work on WaxMOO. I understand pretty much what he wants to do and it gets my stamp of approval. 
<BR>

<BR>
Hopefully, we'll end up with the means to make -any- object accessible via web. BUT, to really make an object usable, one needs to do some hacking. There will be verbs on #1 that all objects will inherit, but to really use them, a parent class will need to be created to elaborate on the verbs.
<BR>

<BR>
(like, as a metaphor, any room has the ability to be described, but isn't really useful until you -do- describe it.)
<BR>

<BR>
So, this is my `go ahead' for giving him a wizbit. I think he'll do some interesting work with it. Go for it Patro. (Or, I can do it or whatever)

I imagine lots of people would. Security is optional on the #262, right? Perhaps we can simply @chparent #955 to #262?  Or would we rather make a child of #262 that does the same thing as #955? I think that people would tend towards wanting security more than seats.

<BR>
These people and objects probably don't have a valid .home (or don't define that property). Objects which don't have a .home property are sent to #-1 if they are @ejected. Players which have a bad .home, are sent to $player_start, or #11, when @ejected. The verbs there should put unconnected players into $limbo once they enter.
<BR>

<BR>
Can you be more specific about what you found there, what you typed, and what happened/didn't happen?
<BR>

<BR>
Also, are you aware of the @eject! and @eject!! aliases? The single and double exclamation point reflect the amount of authority/power. The @eject!! verb should be absolutely undeniable. That object -should- be gone.
<BR>

<BR>
I figure some of these objects have bad homes and bad :movetos, but I need specifics to be sure.
