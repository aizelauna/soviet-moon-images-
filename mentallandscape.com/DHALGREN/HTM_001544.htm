&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Showers are a places where the sweaty muscle-men come after a long workout. There is communal shower, with room for six people, and more besides. A bench for your clothes is at the side of the room. It is steamy and warm...and there is the distinct smell of men in the air. Go join them!
