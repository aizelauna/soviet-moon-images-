&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on a small rain-soaked ledge on one of the bridge's piers, midway in the river.  The polluted waters lap against the concrete around you.  You squint up into the hazy sky and notice a steel ladder going up the side of the pier.

You climb the long rusty ladder, pausing to rest a few times.  Finally you reach the top and scramble over the railing of the bridge.

You throw your weight into the door to the east, which finally gives way.  You step through.
