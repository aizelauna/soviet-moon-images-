&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAround you, trees of all kinds rise tall inte the air. The sun's rays shine less brightly here, as the foliage is dense enough to block most of them. Underbrush, from bushes to ferns, covers the ground. There is a stepdisc to your north. Somewhere near you, you hear birds chirping.
