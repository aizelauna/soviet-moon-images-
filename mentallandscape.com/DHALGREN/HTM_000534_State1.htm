<H3>statue (#534): unveiled</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA monumental creation in shiny pink stone stands revealed as the dust settles.  A naked boy is bending over a sleeping comrade with evident intention to waken him with a flute.  One hand is holding the flute, the other reaching for a piece of cloth draped over the sleeper's middle.  The cloth bulges suggestively.  Both boys wear a flower behind the ear, identical expressions, dreamy and brutal, depraved and innocent.
