&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Literally, 'World Goddess'. The ancients used to believe gem stones were
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp solidified drops of the divine essence, embedded in rocks when the world
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp was created. Diamonds were sacred to the Mother of the gods because they
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 'ruled' all other stones by their superior hardness.   In Tantric Tibet,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the divine essence of the Earth-goddess Tara is still assumed to inhabit
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp her human incarnation,  the Diamond Sow, traditional consort or feminine
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp counterpart of the Dalai Lama.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Because  diamonds were sacred to the supreme  Goddess, they were taken
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp over by  the cult of  the Virgin;  and  because of this association with
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp virginity they came to be considered appropriate betrothal gifts. In the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp transition from  TAROT cards to  modern playing cards, diamonds replaced
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp the ancient suit of pentacles, which were symbols of Mother Earth (Tara)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and of the feminine earth element."
