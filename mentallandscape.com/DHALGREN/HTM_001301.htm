&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you first see this person, you get the distinct feeling that you've met them before. You're not sure where you met them, but only that you have. As time passes, you notice that this persons presence makes you slightly uncomfortable. Then all of a sudden, you remember. You were five years old. You had eaten an entire box of macaroni and cheese and drunk a whole pitcher of cherry kool-aid. The experience is best forgotten.
