After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnacreon is deep in his cups.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnacreon sings softly to himself:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Anacreon sings) --   Striking me with his scarlet ball
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 --                    Gold-haired Eros
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 --                    Calls me to play
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 -- with the girl in the colored shoes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnacreon pauses...there's more...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe old guy sighs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(Anacreon sings) --   But she, she's from strong-walled
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 --       Lesbos, and because it's grey
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 --                 scorns my old hair,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 --            looking to another girl.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnacreon looks around himself, wondering where the wine went.
