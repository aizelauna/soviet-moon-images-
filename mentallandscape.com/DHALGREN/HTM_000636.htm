&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a man wearing a helmet surmounted by a crown.  He is seated on a cubical stone.  His right hand holds a sceptre and his right leg is bent and rests on the other in the form of a cross.  The cubical stone, image of the perfect solid, signifies the accomplishments of human labour.  The crowned helmet is the emblem of the strength that conquers power.  This dominating figure holds the sceptre of Isis, and the stone which serves him as a throne signifies conquered matter.  The cross described by the position of his limbs symbolises the four elements and the expansion of human power in every direction.
