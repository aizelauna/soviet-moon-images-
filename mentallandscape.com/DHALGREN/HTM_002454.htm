Subj: yet another list
<BR>

<BR>
Because I'm the one who posted the last thing to *cttr about websites, and because I have a mailing list fetish, I've gone ahead and made a list for WWW stuff.  *web, *www, *w.  I'll go ahead and forward all of the various web-ly posts to it; future posts should be sent there, I guess.
<BR>

<BR>
One thing I'm wondering:  should this list just be for sites &c, or should we move the discussion of the MOO-WWW interface there too?

<BR>
Well, I've changed my mind about forwarding all the web stuff over here.  There's a fair amount of it, and I don't feel like burning quota, so.  Here's a list of the message numbers that have gone by so far, talking about this sort of thing.

Subj: Burroughs page

There's a new William Burroughs website at http://www.hyperreal.com/wsb/
<BR>
Looks pretty good; lots of links which I haven't had the time to check out yet.

Subj: Delirium
<BR>

<BR>
Douglas Cooper's hypertext nove-in-progress, _Delirium_, is at http://www.timeinc.com/~twep/Features/Delirium/DelTitle.html
<BR>
Cooper is the author of one previous (conventionally published novel), _Amnesia_, which interested and irritated me in equal measure. He's a very good stylist, and an intellectually stimulating writer; though ultimately I find him lacking in _vision_. But his new work, stylistically homogeneous with what came before, has the added interest of exploring the capabilities of hypertext format more interestingly than anything else I've seen this side of WAX.

Subj: Why?
<BR>

<BR>
I'm wondering why folks are interested in linking MOOs (generally, Dhalgren, specifically) to Web pages? Is easy access better? For what? Whom?
<BR>
Just curious about the reasons...  Stellah

Subj: Why the Web?
<BR>

<BR>
1) Why not? Nothing is true. Everything is permitted.
<BR>

<BR>
2) The Web is to the Internet what Ma Bell was to the umpteen telephone service providers at the turn of the century -- the unifying protocol for information transfer. Quite simply, the Web is the future.
<BR>

<BR>
3) Being on the Web is like automatically being included in a popular Internet directory. The MOO can be connected to like-minded sites (sci-fi, postmodernism, etc.) and the "audience" for our creative efforts will grow exponentially, as browsers stumble across us.
<BR>

<BR>
4) The Web allows for expansions beyond text -- graphics, sound, movies. It's an infrastructure tailor-made for any future increases in bandwidth on the Net. Right now pictures are loaded middling-slow, other media at a snail's pace, but that is bound to change.
<BR>

<BR>
5) Web rules.

Subj: Why the web
<BR>

<BR>
Well, I don't thihk HTTP is going to take us too much further because its such a braindamaged protocol and it doesn't support interaction.  But in the meantime, the web is pretty much the standard for multimedia hypertext.

Subj: re: why
<BR>

<BR>
Marcus agrees with Patro about HTTP: it's kind of a cobblestone entrance-
<BR>
ramp onto a highway that hasn't been built and doesn't yet have anyplace
<BR>
to go.
<BR>
But better protocols are being worked on; and for those of us who can't
<BR>
or won't do that development, but want to get our feet wet in networked
<BR>
hypertext ... well, www ain't bad. At least we'll get a sense of possibi-
<BR>
lities and present limitations. And might make some cool stuff.

Subj: More why...
<BR>

<BR>
As a webmaster at a couple places at my university I understand the usefulness of it as a transition platform for online multimedia/browsing.
<BR>
What I wonder about, though, is why would Dhalgren want to attract ... crowds?
<BR>
I'm not convinced there are virtues in being accessible, easy-to-use, or multiply-linked into existing/future infrastructures.
<BR>
Why?
<BR>
I think there IS virtue in working for your literacy, because in the process you become socialized into the culture. 
<BR>
Call me elitist, but I'm also skeptical that the kind of traffic increase you could get with the Web would be the kind of traffic increase that's most desirable.
<BR>
There are better reasons for building/doing things than 'because you can.'
<BR>
Skeptically,

Subj: FurryMUCK home page
<BR>

<BR>
Check out http://www.furry.com/
<BR>

<BR>
This is a great collection of web pages with the latest HTML3 and Netscape 1.1 features in use.  Nice artwork, including a background image of little animal tracks (if you have a new enough browser to use it).
<BR>
FurryMUCK and its satellites (RealmsMUCK, etc) are the most creative, perverted community to emerge from virtual reality.  Be sure to check out their images (thousands of gif files of drawings) and stories.
<BR>

<BR>
Stephen White wrote MUCK before he wrote MOO.  But the associated cultures are very different.  Despite the superior server technology, MOOs seem to be disapointingly geeky compared to many other MUDs on the net.  Furry is also more of a community than most MUDs.
