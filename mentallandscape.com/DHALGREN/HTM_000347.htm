&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou barely make out the shadowy outline of a carved doorway to the north. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you see the doorway is carved in the shape of an archway with a crouching gryphon over the lintel. Inky darkness whirls in the center of the doorway and appears to suck what little light exists in the tunnel into its midst.
