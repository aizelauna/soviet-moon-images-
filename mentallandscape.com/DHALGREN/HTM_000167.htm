&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour feet spash a puddle of rain water.  In the hazy daylight, you look around the intersection of Broadway and Brisbain avenue.  The houses around you are porched and lawned and spacious and columned, all have broken windows.  To the northwest is an estate surrounded by a stone wall.  You see a gate of verdigrised brass, spiked at the top.  A brass plate, streaked pink with recent polish, says: ROGER CALKINS.  To the southeast is an abandoned mansion. To the northeast is a graveyard.
