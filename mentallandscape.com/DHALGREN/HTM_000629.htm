&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBenedick does not look like Kenneth Branagh. He is not a jocular fop, a co-dependant, or a bleeding heart. He is not dressed in a flouncy mock-Renaissance chemise, hose and doublet, or the unbiquitous pointy black shoes. He is not generic cyber-hunk, nor is he the great unmanifest. He wears an easy smile and displays a variegated wit, but only if the door is closed and the blinds are drawn tight.
