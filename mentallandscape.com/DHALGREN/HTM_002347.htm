&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn odor of incredible mass greets you at the door. Your eyes sting, burning from the new environment. Your skin begins to itch and your ears buzz. Before long your eyes are washed clean by your tears and before you in the smoke-crammed blackness are grey figures moving slowly around a central spindle. You begin to distinguish the smell of blood, roses, vomit, plums, urine, oatmeal, and shit. The enire room is an embodied bowel where desire is the byproduct of the efforts. You notice on one wall a vast collection of whips some with salt-dipped tips, others with razors attached, still more with bodies of bees tied to them. Sign on door reads: No Masochists Allowed. Rape, desecr(e)ation, transgression, murder, cannibalism, torture and cruelties.
