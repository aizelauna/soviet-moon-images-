&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou keep me waiting in a truck with its one good wheel stuck in the ditch, while you piss against the south side of a tree. Hurry. I've got nothing on under my skirt tonight. That still excites you, but this pickup has no windows and the seat, one fake leather thigh, pressed close to mine is cold. I'm the same size, shape, make as twenty years ago, but get inside me, start the engine; you'll have the strength, the will to move. I'll pull, you push, we'll tear each other in half. Come on, baby, lay me down on my back. Pretend you don't owe me a thing and maybe we'll roll out of here, leaving the past stacked up behind us; old newspapers nobody's ever got to read again.
