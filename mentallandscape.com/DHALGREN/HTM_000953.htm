&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLarge, glass, warped. A delicate web of cracks crawls across the pane facing you, distorting your view of the contents.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
<BR>
You sink down onto the battered chaise longue, avoiding the broken spring and coughing a little from the dust.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ghost of red velvet tattered battered wornout laced with dust.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A tottering stack of old 'Love and Rockets.' The covers are worn and torn, pages crumpled and yellow, thumbed to the consistency of thin linen.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001403.htm">strapon</A> and <A HREF="HTM_000907.htm">melusina</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ L&R ] <A HREF="HTM_002030.htm">Love&Rockets #23</A>.
You flip open the cover of #23 and are mesmerized by the images inside...
