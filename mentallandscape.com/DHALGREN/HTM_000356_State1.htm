<H3>Caveman (#356): wary</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a short, stout man with long black hair and roughly made fur clothing.  From the prominent brow ridge, massive nose and swept-back cheekbones, you suspect he is a member of the species _Homo neanderthalensis_.  He is standing and watching you with caution.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe is awake and looks alert.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356_State1.htm">feed</A> ] feeds the Caveman. The Neanderthal grunts and smiles, taking her offering and eating quickly and messily.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356.htm">club</A> ] knocks the Caveman unconscious with her club.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356_State1.htm">wake</A> ] nudges the Caveman again to make sure he's awake. The Neanderthal is awake and grunts back at her.
