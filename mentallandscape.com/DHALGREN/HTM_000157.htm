&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA boy, white and slender as flame, dressed in a silver, lame G-string. His eyes are silvery, arrogant, his mouth a mocking curve. His ash-pale hair is flecked with iridescent glitter. Around his neck hangs strands of mirrors, prisms, lenses that glitter and flash in the candlelight.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen he dances, taut, wiry muscles bunch and flex beneath smooth, white skin.  One small, brown nipple is pierced with a glowing, violet ring. His belly is flat and tight, with a pale arrow of hair just under the navel that disappears beneath his G-string.
