&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA shattered window allows you a view of the weeds growing behind the Cathedral, and a rat scurries across the cold stone floor.  The only illumination comes from the window, and the Preparation Chamber.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You find there is not much to see but a tiny, dusty room. with a door leading another direction.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000456.htm">Preparation Chamber</A>.
You head east, trying to find your way out of here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You gaze up the staircase, but cannot penetrate the darkness above.
[ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000998.htm">Tower Chamber</A>.
You cautiously make your way up the creaky wooden stairs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Beyond the first few steps, it is hard to see anything but a faint light at the bottom of the staircase.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_000988.htm">Entrance Passage</A>.
You peer cautiously ahead of you as you make your way down the steps.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a battered wooden door which lacks a doorknob, but does have a rusty latch somewhat attached to it.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_002571.htm">Gardening At Night</A>.
You pull the door to the north open by the latch, and head into the darkness.
