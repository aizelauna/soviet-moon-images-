&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is an abstract fountain tucked away among some trailing grape ivy. Through six inches of water you can see lots of pennies and someone's autographed TARDIS key. Little origami cranes and boats float on the water, as well as on occasional paper airplane. Water trickles down from the top out of what suspiciously resembles lion heads but... You aren't quite sure.
