&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith wild black hair that stands up in short erratic spikes as though
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptrying to escape from her head, polyhymnia surveys you with a
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcapricious glint in her wide ice-blue eyes. As she turns her head to
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmeet your glance, you can't help noticing how the light gleams off of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa motley collection of silver hoops which line her ears. You suspect
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthat polyhymnia might be preoccupied as you catch the quiet sound of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher humming 'Obscene and Pornographic Art' under her breath.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVisitor wears a lovely puffy silverybrown tail. She looks quite like a squirrel.
