&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA Plum
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthink of this plum
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthink of this plum so round and ripe
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspconsider her color:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdeeply red, engorged with hue
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthink of this plum
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthink of her skin, so smooth, so tight
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthink of how she gives in to you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwhen you bite
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphow her skin gives in to you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto your mouth and teeth
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphow she gives her sweetness to you
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher juice in your mouth, on your tongue
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe taste of her flesh
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspso sweet in your mouth
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspso soft.
