<H3>Tattooed Lady (#940): suspicious</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou avoid the Tattooed Lady's eye and lean in for a closer look. The blue smudges appear to be some sort of miniscule writing...as you squint in an effort to make out what the characters are, you catch sight of a larger string of letters spiraling out from her left nipple and encircling her breast: 'Hereon, the entire contents of a mystical book once known as The Oxford English Dictionary.' Be warned...the Tattooed Lady takes herself very seriously, and she's already suspicious of you...it would be unwise to mock her at this point.
