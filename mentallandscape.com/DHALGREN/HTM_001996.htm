&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of bubbling.  I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued.  It sounded like air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out.  I looked at the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it.  At last!  On closer inspection I saw that the disc of bone was much deeper on one side than on the other.   Obviously the trepan had not been straight and had gone through at one point only, then the piece of bone had snapped off and come out.  I was reluctant to start drilling again for fear of damaging the brain membranes with the deeper part while I was cutting through the rest or of breaking off a splinter.  If only I had an electric drill it would have been so much simpler.  Amanda was sure I was through.  There seemed no other explanation for the schlurping noises.  I decided to call it a day.  At the time I thought that any hole would do, no matter what size.  I bandaged up my head and cleared away the mess.
