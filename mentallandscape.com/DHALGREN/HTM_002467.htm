&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou would think that a swath of green in this desolation would be generous, poetic even---a refuge for those on their wandering way.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBut you wonder...should you sing in it?--or should you mow it?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining this day in Bellona.
