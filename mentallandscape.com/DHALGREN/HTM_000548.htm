(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000176.htm">Generic Ambient Noise Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000510.htm">Saffron</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA vast room. Things spin, twinkle in an endless dance, circular,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspinate. Endless things, uncounted things.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe bigger thing is many jointed; dozens of arms, manipulators,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptipped with pliers, hexdrivers, knives, a subminature circular saw,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa dentist's drill . . . 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt must have been a construction remote at some time. Then it was
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwelded, shot upside down in the dome, merged. Fused. Hundreds of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcables and optic lines snake across the geodesics to enter it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt intervals, things swing past. Memories. You've been here before.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_000510.htm">Saffron</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA yellowing kid glove swings past
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSlowly tumbling. The faceted stopper from a vial of vanished perfume.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn armless doll with a scarred face of old porcelain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt makes you want to laugh. But there are sadnesses and sadnesses.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRectangular sections of perf-board.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe crumpled snake of a green and red cravat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEndless, this slow swarm; spinning things.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn old hair ribbon, once creame.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA caps lock key, lost once. Now here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou knew this once. The distance. The time
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDistant, you heard a voice. "My songs are of time and distance. Watch my arms."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is only the dance. These things you treasure are shells.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA peice of flaking mirror.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSeveral old, faded pages.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpinning, a bottle of old herbs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA whisper, indistinct "I sing with these things around me, fragments."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne of the manipulators moves, brushing close against you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA torn map.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJunked strands of bright cable, resistive.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSpinning mylar, lost once.
