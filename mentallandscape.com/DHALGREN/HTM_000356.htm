&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a short, stout man with long black hair and roughly made fur clothing.  From the prominent brow ridge, massive nose and swept-back cheekbones, you suspect he is a member of the species _Homo neanderthalensis_.  Thought to have become exinct in the late Pleistocene, he is a surprising find here!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe is sleeping.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356.htm">feed</A> ] tries to feed the Caveman. But she fails to get the attention of the sleeping Neanderthal.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356.htm">club</A> ] raises her club and clobbers the sleeping Caveman. Now he is really sleeping!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000356_State1.htm">wake</A> ] wakes the Caveman with a nudge. The Neanderthal eyes visitor warily, looking her up and down.
