&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a field that a half-clouded moon illuminates with a vague twilight.  A tower stands on each side of a path that disappears into a barren landscape.  In front of one of these two towers a dog is crouching; in front of the other, a dog is baying at the moon; between them is a crab.  These towers symbolise the false security which does not foresee hidden perils.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe hostile spirits, symbolised by on dog, wait in ambush; the servile spirits, symbolised by the other, conceal their trecheries with base flattery; and the idle spirits, symbolised by the crab, will pass by without the slightest concern for disaster.
