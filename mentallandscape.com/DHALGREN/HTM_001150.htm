&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     T'ai-chi Classics
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   As soon as one moves,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   the entire body should be light and sensitive,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and all its parts connected.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   The ch'i should be roused and the spirit gathered within.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Do not allow gaps;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   do not allow bulges or hollows;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   do not allow discontinuities.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   The root is in the feet,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   energy issues up through the legs,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   is controlled by the waist
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and is expressed in the hands and fingers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   From the feet to the legs to the waist
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   should be one complete flow of ch'i.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   One will then be able to seize opportunities
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and occupy the superior position.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   If one is unable to seize opportunities
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and gain the superior position,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   the body will be scattered and in confusion.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Look for the weakness in the waist and the legs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   The same is true for above and below,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   front and back, left and right.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   All of this has to do with the mind
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and not externals.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   If there is an above, there must be a below;
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   if there is a fore, there must be a rear,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and if there is a left there must be a right.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   If the intention is to rise,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   one must pay attention to below.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   If you want to lift something,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   you must apply breaking power.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   In this way, its root will be severed,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and its destruction
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   will be swift and inevitable.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Full and Empty should be clearly distinguished.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   Any given point has the potential for full or empty
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   and the whole body has this dual aspect: full and empty.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   All the joints of the body
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   should be connected
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   without permitting the slightest break.
