(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001549.htm">Redlance</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYoung, a little short and looking curious around him. He has a tight-long redish freeflowing hair held in place with an faded old decorated headband.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe is dressed in an well worn open vest with nothing underneath.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe's jeans is worn through in a couple of places and too long, so the legs have been roled up. He has bare, black, tough looking feet with little black hairs all over. And on one toe on the right foot is a gleaming gold ring.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd all the time he smokes on a old black pipe, and tries to make smoke rings.
