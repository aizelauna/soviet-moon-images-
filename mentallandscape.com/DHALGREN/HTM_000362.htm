&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWater laps at the end of the rock ledge, and the cavern widens into a domed chamber of rock.  The room is filled with a roaring whirlpool of water, as an underground river enters the chamber from the side and drains into some unseen fissure far below.  The ledge extends back to the south.  You must "jump" into the maelstrom to proceed north.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe signs here explain how to build new rooms and exits of your own.

You walk south.  Did you "jump" or "dive" into the whirlpool?  Come on, just take a deep breath and go for it!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a roaring whirlpool filling the chamber.

You take a deep breath and dive in!  You tred water and circle around a few times, faster as you approach the center of the vortex.  Finally, you are sucked under and find yourself speeding through an underwater tunnel.  The tunnel seems to narrow somewhat and the current speeds up.  You're starting to run out of breath!  Suddenly you are spewed out into an underground river, gasping for air.  You swim over to the shore and climb out of the water, dripping wet and exhausted.
