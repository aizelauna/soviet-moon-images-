&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining and secure this day in Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA spacious chamber, dark yet unoppressive, the air filled with a thousand scents battling for your attention, the Casbah is at once comfortably familiar and deliciously exotic.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeneath the stone arches, silken pillows litter the priceless carpets, low tables bear brass lamps, trays of dates and figs, flasks of fine wines, and a variety of rare oils.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThrough the great lattice-covered windows the spires and minarets are visible as they strain toward the sky.  The sounds of the marketplace rise from the busy street below: voices haggling, laughing, singing, the chatter of birds, the clucking of fowl,  the barking of dogs.  In the distance, you hear the urgent cry of the muezin.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere is a refuge from the demands of everyday life, an oasis of solitude to refresh the spirit...and the flesh.
