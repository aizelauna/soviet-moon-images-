&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on a narrow footbridge just below water level and thus hidden by the surface.  You can see the shore to the northeast, and a rather well-defended island to the southwest.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The footbridge, as far as you can tell, runs right up to the palisade, so there must be a door there.

You search the nearest portion of the palisade for a way in, and find a door.  You enter, closing the door behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can see the waterfront from here.  Just follow the bridge, and watch your step.

Placing your feet carefully, you walk toward the shore.
