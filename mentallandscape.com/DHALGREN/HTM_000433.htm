After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFour hands clasp you, drawing you against Shiva's body.  It seems to transform, one instant cold and hard as metal...the next warm and firm as your own human flesh...then burning with inhuman heat, molten, searing.  Yet when he releases you, your skin is unmarked.  Only your soul is branded.
