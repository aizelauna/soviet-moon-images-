<H3> Moss (#533)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000153.htm">Generic Scorpion Player Class</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000533.htm">Moss</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tall thin giacomettite, arms hanging at his sides, observant eyes. His
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspshort gray hair has been spiked by the wind; sand and dust and gray stubble
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspare matted on his face, accentuating the wrinkles around his eyes. Old scars
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdrift across his forehead, left eyebrow and cheek and neck. His clothes and
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspexposed skin appear to have been sand-blasted into a kind of human driftwood.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHis ambiguously colored work jacket shows a small discolored oval patch where
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa name might have been stitched once; the shadow of unfaded letters spells
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(vid). His dusty work trousers show a battered crease, and the sandy patina
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof the cuffs blur into scarred biker boots. You notice a slight swaying,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspslow, subrhythmic.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHe has a brass chain of mirrors, lenses and prisms wrapped around his neck and waist.
