&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis stretch of hallway is devoid of furnishings except for the single oil lamp hanging from a hook. The silence is deafening and leans on you heavily.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001094.htm">Narrow Hallway</A>.
You head up the hallway.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hallway leads into darkness to the south.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001104.htm">Hallway Intersection</A>.
