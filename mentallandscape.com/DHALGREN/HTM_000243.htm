&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on the southern stretch of Broadway. To the west you see burning piers and docks, and bits of ship remains. To the east you see a large mansion. The front door of the place glows of an eerie purple light, and there appear to be candles moving behind some of the windows on the second floor.
