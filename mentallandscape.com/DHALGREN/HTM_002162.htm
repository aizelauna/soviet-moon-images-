<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA disorderly pile of detritus, fit to be burned at the end of the growing year. Mementoes of the previous year's ephemeral trends; effigies of lost loves and abandoned hopes; dead leaves and branches, all lashed together with baling wire.
<BR>
<BR>
Burning noises:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A FREE OJ T-shirt catches fire, blazes briefly, and is gone.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Flames leap heavenward from the Samhain pyre, pleasing the dark gods.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A flurry of sparks from the bonfire blows across the lot, with a sudden gust of wind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The fire suddenly pops and burns in strange colors as the flames hit an over-varnished piece of ugly furniture.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A small swarm of 3x5 index cards arrives and is engulfed in flame.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Flames swarm over a small silver and onyx ring, turning the sparkling silver to black.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Caught in Samhain flames, things surrender their names, become their unbecome selves, to the indivisibles return.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The fluid of the passing year eddies, passing through the cleansing filter of fire sinister Samhain.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A happy sizzle and a pop! as the fire greets Abigail...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The ghost of Charles Babbage comes to warm his hands at the Samhain Fire.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Distant music from distant spheres, a wail:  "I only have one burning desire -- let me stand next to your fire..."
