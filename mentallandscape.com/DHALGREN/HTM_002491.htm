&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe place you are standing in is obviously being remodeled...cigarette butts, paper coffee cups from Greek diners, tufts of pink insulating material, and an assortment of screws, nails, and wires litter the floor. Standing in one corner is a rolled up futon; in the middle of the room, next to a can of black latex & a dirty roller, is a box of CD's and a stereo.
