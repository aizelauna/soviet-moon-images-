&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a small clearing in a grove of huge willow trees.  Their branches spread out and mingle with each other, forming a canopy that opens to the sky above you.   Through the clearing is a small dirt path that is covered with scattered leaves, and beside the path is a small bulletin board made of carved spruce.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEach of the willows on the edge of this clearing has a name scratched into the bark and little pieces of wood nailed to the trunk that lead up into the branches overhead, where you see small tree houses.
