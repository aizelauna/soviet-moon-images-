&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA deadly orchid.
<BR>
<BR>
Go to location of this object, <A HREF="HTM_002179.htm">Steelgrave</A>.

<BR>
After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cage of blades curls around his closed fist.  He opens it, flexing his fingers so the orchid's sharp petals flare and glitter.  Suddenly, he slashes - slicing the air an excruciating fraction of an inch from your face.  Steelgrave smiles.  His eyes flash with hard metallic light.
