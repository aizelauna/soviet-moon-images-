<H3> Crypt (#344)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000110.htm">Generic Post-Apocalypse Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000215.htm">Kashka</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe room is shaped like a pentagram with a raised dais in the center. The ceiling hangs low over your head--painted with erotic and occult scenes in faded colors. The walls are carved and painted with symbols and pictogryphs. On the dais you see a large, stone sarcaphagus made out of black marble veined with green. The floor is paved with stone tiles--predominately black, indigo, green and silver. The tiles surrounding the dais depict the 12 houses of the zodiac.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cold draft sighs mournfully through the tunnels outside the crypt..
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The sarcaphagus is stone--ebon marble veined with green--and sits in the center of the room. It is roughly 9 feet by 4 feet. The lid is carved with a rayed sun surrounding alpha and omega. The rays stretch out and cover the entire surface, even winding down over the sides of the lid. The sides of the stone coffin are carved with occult symbols and words in a language which you don't recognize. You suddenly wonder if you could open it.

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe symbols incised in the floor begin to glow softly with ruby light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA soft muted humming sound fills the air with mystery.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe sigil of Sagitarious glows redly in the dim light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe two Piscean fish suddenly shimmer with light and leap into the air.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tile depicting Aquarious glows with blue light. You hear water dripping
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA golden mist drops down out of the ceiling, bathing your face in freshness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA complex cadence drums out from some unknown place.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tile depicting aries glows viridian in the dimness of the crypt.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith a clash sound the image of the Librian scales hovers in the air.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sheen of light washes down the walls and pools on the floor of the room.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a glimmer of golden light shine from inside the sarcaphagus.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspScorpio glows red in the dim crypt.  You hear scorpions skittering.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the snorting of bulls; the tile depicting Taurus glows blue.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA voice whispers 'what is your desire?'
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMusic shimmers in the air.
