(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000875.htm">Rebis</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA filthy, dimly-lit room. A large ceiling fan turns rapidly, but fails to displace or freshen the stagnant, pestilential air.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCots are strewn around the room, seemingly at random. Patients lie on most of them, bodies deformed by huge suppurating sores. Some writhe in agony; others lie blissed out in an opium stupor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOne cot is vacant, and there is a table against the far wall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the southwest corner, you see
<BR>
<BR>
You lie on the Cot. Uh-oh. Nobody has changed the sheets in ages...It's still smelly and dirty from the last patient. Suddenly you feel itchy all over; rashes develop on exposed parts of your body....
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a small metal operating table, on wheels. It is covered with ground-out cigarette buts and ash. Surgical implements lie scattered about: a rusty scalpel, a pair of pliers encrusted with dried blood, a needle and thread. At one end of the table, there's an enormous bowl filled with pills of various shapes & colors.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An enormous bowl, the size of a fish tank, filled to the brim with red, blue, yellow, and green pills.
<BR>
<BR>
