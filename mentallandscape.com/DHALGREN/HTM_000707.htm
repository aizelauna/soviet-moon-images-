&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou step across a worn lump of cement into a damp room. It extends back away from you about fifty yards where you can see the cement block wall dimly illuminated by a bulb hanging from the high ceiling. As you wander back towards the back you notice bulbs above your head that once must have made a path of light to the back. Now, it's dark. The cement floor and broken brick walls become increasingly more damp, wet and slick. The right side wall has large steel brackets bolted into the broken bricks. they are empty now, but, from their sagged worn look used to hold long, heavy items of some sort. The left side opens into a wide storage space.
