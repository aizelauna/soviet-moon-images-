&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspParked cars surround you, most of which have rocks firmly embedded in the tires. Parking here is free, initially, but it must cost a fortune to remove the dents caused by flying rocks! Pennants and banners wave to your west.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Town Square is off to the east.

You return to the Town Square, brushing gravel from your feet.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The duck pond is to the west, and the banners and pennants are beyond it. Lucky for you, there is a wooden bridge upon which you can cross, if you can get past the horrendous crowd on it.

You head for the bridge, hoping to push your way across.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cars, trucks, and vans of all shapes and sizes are parked here. It reminds you a bit of a used car lot. A respectable dealer, however, would have a few cars not equipped with dents from this lot.
