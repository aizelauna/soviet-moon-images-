&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a young man with a delicate form and mannered speech. His demeanor betokens some combination of relaxation, exasperation, contentment, resignation, and affection, but seems immune to anger. His preference for simplicity and sensuality is reflected in his dress: a jewel-toned loose silk shirt tucked into black jeans, appropriate to his sub-tropical clime. Full, dark lips wrap themselves about his cascade of syllables, alternatingly languorous and crankily precise. A curly lock of dark hair graces his weary face, which occasionally flashes a whimsical grin. He is endeavoring to become an competent fretless bassist, saxophonist, hiker, photographer, expert in (world-gothic-dreampop-experimental-dub-ambient) musics and a gainfully employed engineer. Godot's velvet-brown eyes return your gaze from between long black lashes.
