&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspContrary to all expectations, this room seems to have survived the destruction of the city, although the building which was above it has crumbled into a pile of rubble. There is a comfortable looking couch against one of the walls. A large billiards table takes up space in the center of the room, and a well-stocked bar is in the corner. Light finding it's way through the rubble above keeps the room from being too dim.
