&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe years have taken their toll on this spirit. Loose fitting clothes surround what once was a strong and nimble body. Though she stoops now and there are scars around her wrists you think twice before coming too close. Her long hair is generously streaked with grey and a thick piece of leather holds it in a braid. Her eyes reflect her name, changing with the light as you easily lose yourself in their swirling colors. In fact if you look too long into their depths you find that the edges begin to blur and things do not seem quite right.
