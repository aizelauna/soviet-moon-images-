<H3>Mazakeen (#430): menacing</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspShe is tall and sleek but radiates an aura of menace.  One half of her head and neck is covered by a black mask--on closer inspection the color is closer to a dark dark rusty red.  Her skin is milky white and flawless, her arms long and lithe.  Raven dark hair tumbles down her back to her waist.  She wears a tight, tunic-like garment made of ruby red material.
