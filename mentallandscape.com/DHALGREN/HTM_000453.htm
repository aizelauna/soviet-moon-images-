&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSailor is polishing his nails on the lapels of his glen plaid suit. He whistles a little tune through his shiny, yellow teeth.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000453_State1.htm">drug</A> ] drugs the sailor. Sailor pulls out a lead tube. He cuts one end of the tube with a little curved knife. A black mist pours out and hangs in the air like boiling fur. The Sailor's face dissolves. His mouth undulates forward on a long tube and sucks in the black fuzz, vibrating in supersonic peristalsis dissappears in a silent, pink explosion.
