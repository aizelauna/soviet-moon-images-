&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou have climbed up onto the surface of an enormous green lilypad which hovers in the air above the Roof Garden.  The lilypad is quite green and shiny, soft and cushy to sit on.  It smells of water and sunshine.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the middle of the lilypad is a large waterlily, its petals open to expose a chamber orchestra made up of frogs.  They are dressed in formal black tailcoats with ornate broacade vests with tiny silver acorn buttons.  Each frog wears a small powdered wig.  If you look closely you will notice that each wig is a surprising color (fuschia, chartreuse, magenta, cerulian).  The frogs play beautiful ancient instruments for your pleasure -- a flute, an oboe, a bassoon, violins, violas, cellos, bassess -- and off to one side, a gorgeous harpsichord.  Seated at the harpsichord is a mayfly -- her transparent wings fluttering in the air behind her as she plays.  The conductor is a dragonfly (of course).  His tailcoat is metallic green and blue and shimmers like the surface of a lake.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBelow you is the roof garden, its plants thriving in the air.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDaylight pours over the lilypad like honey.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRain patters on the surface of the lilypad.  The musicians have raised a large purple umbrella and play on.
<BR>
<BR>
You sit comfortably on the lilypad.  It feels soft beneath you and holds you effortlessly in the air.

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe conducter taps his stand.  The musicians prepare to play.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe soft sounds of Bach drift across the sky.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA flautist stands and plays a gorgeous and complicated sonata by Quantz.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSatie's tinkling noises permeate the air around you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe frogs are hungry and restless.  The conductor is looking a bit nervous.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom somewhere in the back of the orchestra a very large tree frog stands and begins to sing.  He sounds just like Billy Holiday.
