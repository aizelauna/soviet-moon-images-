&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are at the top of a very deep fiery pit, into which robed, chanting priests throw offerings. A wide stone staircase descends toward the town square to the south. A small doorway opens north into the temple. You sense that it might be profitable to make a small sacrifice yourself.

You jump into the pit. You fall! Flames lick at your clothing, threatening to set them on fire. Maybe this wasn't such a good idea...
