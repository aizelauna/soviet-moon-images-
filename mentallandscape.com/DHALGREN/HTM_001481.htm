(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_001016.htm">Generic Container Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001457.htm">Trismegistos</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA creaky and slightly leaky wooden boat, with seating for two on the gunwales,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp powered by an outboard motor. Although its gray paint is peeling in places,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp you can make out the somewhat cryptic name XAPON painted in black on the bow
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and stern. The tiller seems to be stuck at a roughly 30 degree angle to starboard.  
<BR>

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA pink headless plastic baby doll floats by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mutant fur-bearing trout leaps out of the river.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA slab of faded orange styrofoam floats by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA plastic Baggie floats by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBubbles float to the surface of the river, releasing a long-trapped stench.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA section of telephone pole floats by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA bunch of laser-printed pages -- the manual for some geeky computer fantasy game -- float by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA forlorn rubber duckie floats by.
