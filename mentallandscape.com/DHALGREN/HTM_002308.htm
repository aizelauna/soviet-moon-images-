&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBuddy is wearing dusty boots on his feet, a pearl buttoned shirt on his back and a bemused expression on his face. He looks like a skinny kid but he has crinkles around his eyes and there's a little grey in his shiny unkempt hair. He's shivering a little and looks new in town.
