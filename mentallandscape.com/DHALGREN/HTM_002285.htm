This a notice of a new MOOmail list dedicated to a similar venture as that of alt.destroy.the.internet.  Intended to foster discussions of means by which one can aid in the ultimate goal of destroying LambdaMOO, JaysHouseMOO and others.  Please, everyone, please bite the hand that feeds you.

My favourite definition of LambdaMOO: sensory deprivation that yields paranoid, but consensual, delusions.

<BR>
Virtual Reality must be destroyed, as well as the sick society that produces it.

Peronally, I've always toyed with the idea of visiting all the major MOO sites with the pretention of going on a 'tour' but ektually smashing them into tiny tiny pieces.

Is anyone else somewhat upset that there is no VR equivalent to vandalism?  Perhaps someone should create a petition @LMOO in which permissions bitrot is made policy, and we can go around stealing items and changing them.  Even recycling them.  Does anyone think this would pass?  It might, I dunno.

Kill, kill, kill.  Buh?  Yes.  Time for a good smashing.

A request:  Is it the case that recycling one's self does not cause many DB problems if one's possessions are recycled beforehand?

Recycling yourself is fairly harmless if you recycle your possesions beforehand.

After some time there was an ominous sounding schlurp and the sound of  bubbling.  I drew the trepan out and the gurgling continued.  It sounded like  air bubbles running under the skull as they were pressed out.  I looked at  the trepan and there was a bit of bone in it.  At last!  On closer inspection  I saw that the disc of bone was much deeper on one side than on the other.   Obviously the trepan had not been straight and had gone through at one point  only, then the piece of bone had snapped off and come out.  I was reluctant  to start drilling again for fear of damaging the brain membranes with the  deeper part while I was cutting through the rest or of breaking off a  splinter.  If only I had an electric drill it would have been so much  simpler.  Amanda was sure I was through.  There seemed no other explanation  for the schlurping noises.  I decided to call it a day.  At the time I  thought that any hole would do, no matter what size.  I bandaged up my head  and cleared away the mess.

If MacGyver would MOO, he could build a bomb remotely out of hard drive heads and misc. metal and end them all.

Please call his agent.
