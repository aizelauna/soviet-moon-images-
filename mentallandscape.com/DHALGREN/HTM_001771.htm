&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe dark, rocky ceiling of this place spreads in a wide circle above the room, receding into darkness toward its centermost point. Travellers from strange lands, both near and far, lurk among the shadows, hot smoke, and flickering red light cast by the pit, waiting to drop sacrifices to the deity of their choice. The entry archway lies to the west; a wide, stone-cut doorway leads north, while a narrow passageway leads south, down into darkness.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The way to the south has been marked by the scuffling of uncounted feet.

You pass to the south, down a steep, narrow flight of stairs.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The arch to the west now seems rather inviting; you long to escape from the smoke, heat, noise, and confusion.

You go back through the archway.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The pit seems to consume the easternmost end of this cavernous place, filling the rest with smoke and shadow, casting a reddish light up toward the ceiling. Looking into the pit, you can't tell how deep it is; you can only make out the presence of some great fire down below. Oddly-shaped, the edges of the pit are rough, with many outcroppings sticking out from the sides, especially toward the top. The pit's heat covers you with a glaze of sweat.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through this obviously well-used north doorway, you catch glimpses of shadows moving and hear a fair amount of noise and rapid conversation.

You step curiously through the northern doorway.
