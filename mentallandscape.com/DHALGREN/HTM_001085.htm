&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWorn carpeting covers the marble floors at this end of the hall. Once displaying designs and patterns in bright splendor. The walls are clean and bare still, the grey stones set in massive strength. A brass chandelier full of candles gleams in the wan light.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's not clear how far back the hall goes.

You walk down the hall, your footsteps echoing suddenly when the carpet stops.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A small wooden door set into a niche. It is low enough that you would have to duck to get through it.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The stairs are covered with the same carpeting that covers the floor here. Only it seems to get brighter as you look up. But that's only a trick of the light, for it looks dim up there.

You start up the broad staircase, enshrouded in silence.
