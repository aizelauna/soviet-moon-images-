After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  ALL HALLOWS
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  [Louise Gluck, The_House_on_Marshland, 1971]
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Even now this landscape is assembling.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The hills darken. The oxen
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  sleep in their blue yoke,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  the fields having been
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  picked clean, the sheaves
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  bound evenly and piled at the roadside
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  among cinquefoil, as the toothed moon rises:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  This is the barrenness
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  of harvest or pestilence.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  And the wife leaning out the window
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  with her hand extended, as in payment,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  and the seeds,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  distinct, gold, calling
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  *Come_here*
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  *Come_here,_little_one*
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  And the soul creeps out of the tree.
