&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is strong and pungeant odor of feet here as many have passed by here.  There is a divan on which the Dad canrest while the Boy licks his feet clean.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a heavy black door, which seems to have some sort of special material around its perimeter, to prevent air from escaping through it.

You pull hard on the black door, and, with a gasp of rushing air, it opens.  You step into a small vestibule, which lights up as you enter.  The black door closes  behind you, with a whooshing sound, followed by a clank.  Next, you hear a whir of fans, as the air in your little booth freshens and sweetens.  You realize, suddenly, that your nostrils were so accustomed to the foot smell you just left behind, that ordinary air smells sweet!  In a few seconds, the black door at the other end of the vestibule opens by itself, the lights in the booth go off, and you leave the booth.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An archway leading back to the Shithouse:  The curtains hanging in it, on closer inspection, appear to be made of dirty socks left behind by former visitors.

You part the curtains in the archway and step through.
