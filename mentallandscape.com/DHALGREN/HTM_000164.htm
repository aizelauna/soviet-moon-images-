&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe intersection of Broadway and Jackson Avenue.  The haze hides the day sky's variety, stains consciousness, covers the holocaust with something safe and insubstantial.  This is what a *good* neighborhood in Bellona looks like?  The ground floor windows are broken in the white houses around you; curtains hanging out.  The street is clean but wet.  Broadway runs north and south, and you see a ruined church to the northwest.  Jackson continues to the east.
