&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHot, small, walls lacquered crimson, floor chipped dirty-grout violet tile. The sink is full of broken dishes; a pair of rusty pliers leans against the faucet, a stand-in for the hot-water knob. The fridge that won't freeze ice hard enough rattles in the corner:  EAT finger-scrawled across the white door (looks like dried ketchup). A battered kettle on its side near the back burner: it's got a burnt-hole bottom, she fucked up again. She hates it in here, anyway.

You pocket a small sharp piece of china from the pile in the sink before you push your way back out into the other room.
