<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis room looks as if it has been taken over recently. Peeling and
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfaded floral wallpaper is mostly covered by hanging folds of black cloth,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspon which a half finished fire mural is being painted. Cans of paint
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplie on the floor next to the mural. A camp bed has been set in the 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcorner of the room, and a pile of ( black ) clothes is dumped at the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfoot of it. A trestle table holds a primus and a cardboard box of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptins etc.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA door leads onto the street, but it is barracaded shut. Stairs lead down.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lots of tin cans of various types.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Several cans of paint, mostly red and yellow, currently being used to paint a mural on the black cloth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Several meters of black cloth hanging from nails in the floor and ceiling. There is a mural being painted on it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A pile of black jeans and T-shirts. Several socks are nestin here as well. Prominent is a black canvas jacket with lots of pockets.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A camp bed with an new sleeping bag on it. The sleeping bag has a shop security tag on it, and look to have been slept in recently.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A new primus stove. There is a bottle of fluid for it and some matches.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The stove is a primus.
<BR>
