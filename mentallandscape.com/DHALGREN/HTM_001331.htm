&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis corner of The Park is more heavily wooded than the rest, and the trees, mostly oaks and willows, overhang a number of cozy benches. They give onto a delightful view of the lush grass which leads down to the pond. Sitting on the edge of the pond are a few furry couples, and toy sailboats float here and there on the glassy water.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Park spreads to the east and west; in the east it becomes mostly green, verdant lawn, while in the west there is a huge bandstand surrounded by chairs. Through the trees you can see Sable Street to the north, and to the south is of course the pond.
