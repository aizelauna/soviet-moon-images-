<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBackstage is much as you might expect it to be. Cords
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and pulleys look dangerously loose. Piled up are all
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp kinds of props and junk and bits of costume. Squeaks
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp in the darkness suggest there are rats making a meal
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp out of this finery.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can get to the stage by going around to the STAGE
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp or, it seems, head OUTSIDE, through a big steel door
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp to the northeast. To the southeast is an OFFICE door
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp with a big star on it. In the middle are also STAIRS
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp going narrowly down below the stage... to the south,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp finally, a door frame suggests you might MEASURE....
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001239.htm">Chorus Costume</A>, <A HREF="HTM_002516.htm">Darth Vader costume</A>, <A HREF="HTM_000871.htm">Noh Mask</A> and <A HREF="HTM_002087.htm">Vannevar Bush costume</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can slip between dusty curtains to make your way back onstage.
[ stage ] <A HREF="HTM_000820.htm">Stage</A>.
You come on stage.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp In the back you see a door with a big star on it. A sign reads STAGE MANAGER: AUTHORIZED PERSONNEL ONLY.
[ office ] <A HREF="HTM_000898.htm">Stage Manager's Office</A>.
You open the door and go in.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A big steel door creaking on its hinges is kind of stuck but not so that you can't go through it outside...
[ outside ] <A HREF="HTM_000926.htm">Empty Lot</A>.
You shove the door open and come out into an
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Behind the scaffolding to the west is the Pattern Room...
[ measure ] <A HREF="HTM_002106.htm">Pattern Room</A>.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From down below the stairs comes some sound...
[ stairs ] <A HREF="HTM_002025.htm">Below the Stage</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA soft hooting sounds like some kind of bird stuck up in the rafters.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA squeaking sounds like the rats have found the ropes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's kind of stuffy back here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou get a sudden whiff of the aging properties lying around. Phew.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou think you hear an echo...someone singing somewhere?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA harlequin costume hanging on a rack in the back shifts as if to wave.
