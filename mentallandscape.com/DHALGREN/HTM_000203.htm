<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSet in a circle of cobbles, ringed in a decorative fence is an oak.  Its trunk is 
big enough to hide behind and its branches are gnarled and twisted.  Despite the 
toxicity of the air and the acid rain, a few leaves remain on the tree, but these 
are far outnumbered by the strange objects that have been hung or nailed all over 
it, possibly as offerings to local tree gods.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  There's a hammer and plenty of nails lying around.  Feel free to leave your own 
offering.  You never know when you might need the favor of a tree spirit.
