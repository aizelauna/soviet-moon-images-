<H3> Venus Fortune Candle (#210)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000208.htm">generic candle</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000095.htm">legba</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA slender candle, amber colored, made of beeswax and relief-carved with a pattern of lilies and scallop shells.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can't light the Venus Fortune Candle without a match. You rummage through your pockets and fortunately find one. Though it's coated with pocket lint, it flares up into a flame when you stirke it on your shoe.  You light the Venus Fortune Candle
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Venus Fortune Candle sputters and flares as the flame reaches the wax. You smell the sharp sulfur of the match and the scent of honey and cinnamon as the Venus Fortune Candle burns.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe flame of the Venus Fortune Candle leaps up higher now as it burns itself halfway down.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Venus Fortune Candle is reduced now to a small shard of amber wax and a bright flame.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe flame finally consumes the Venus Fortune Candle entirely and extinguishes itself. Where the Venus Fortune Candle once was, you see a small slip of paper.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small slip of amber paper, a little charred at the edges.  It has some writing on it.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It could be love, but then you could have maybe drunk too much coffee this morning.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Maybe you'll get lucky after all. Try nice, smoky viper jazz and fresh oysters.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The love of your dreams is getting insomnia. Quit snoring.
