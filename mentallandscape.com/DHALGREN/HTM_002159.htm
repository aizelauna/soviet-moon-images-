&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDark rock walls, encroaching shadows and jutting shards of granite. Bending low you can scramble to a particularly silent corner piled with leaves and protected by treelimbs roughly pawed into place. Although there's very little light, the lair feels safe, warm - almost a haven. You notice a strong, sharp scent in the air, which registers one immediate thought in your brain: Bear! 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mouth of the cave sends what little light there is bleeding into the velvety dark. Behind a tangle of brambles towards the back of the cave a passageway opens between the rocks.
<BR>
<BR>
The leaves crackle as you settle in and the smell of October is all over you in a minute.
