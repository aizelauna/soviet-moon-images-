&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA shining golden statue of a long-tailed Lynx prowling through an unseen jungle rests 
here. The Lynx has brilliantly crystalline fangs and claws of great sharpness, but 
his large sapphire eyes gleam with warmth and affection, and his tufted ears are 
focused at you attentively. The statue's fur is so well crafted that the Lynx seems 
very cuddlesome and cute indeed.
