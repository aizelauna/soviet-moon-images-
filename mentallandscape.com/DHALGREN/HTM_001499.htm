<H3> The Hermaphrodite (#1499)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001551.htm">Kalessin</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe tent flaps creak and hiss as you push through them into this space.  Murmurs whisper through the outer tent fabric from the phantasmal crowds outside, and it takes a while for your attention to focus on the stage.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFaded, dirty carnival signs proclaim various bargains for your buck, centered around this freakish resident's androgynous attributes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe stage holds a stool with a sign on it, depicting what looks like a half black and half white person on it.  It's difficult to tell without a closer look.  A single, yellowish spotlight pierces the murky tent filtered light, illumniating the sign.  About two dozen folding chairs are arranged in a small semi-circle around the stage, and it looks like these chairs would put you at a perfect height to peer under someone's skirt, were such a person seated on the stool.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
<BR>
You sit on the stool, feeling tingly and courageous.  It is no small thing, sitting on this stool.
<BR>
<BR>
í
<BR>
You are holding <A HREF="HTM_002029.htm">Newborn</A>.<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The stool is medium height, made from old, dark stained, white paint splattered, cracked and taped wood.  It looks creaky and unstable.  There's a sign taped to it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The sign on the stool depicts an artist's conception of a formally dressed hermaphrodite about to marry eirself.  One side of this person is dressed as a bridegroom, including tails and top hat, a single lensed pair of spectacles, and an elegant curled mustache.  The other side is dressed as a virginal bride, including laced veil, flowers, modest lipstick and a huge billowing skirt.  The details of the interface between the two are suitably obscured and uneventful.  The single couple is shown dancing a waltz with eirself.  Who can tell who's leading and who's not?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The posters hanging on the tent walls are old, faded and weather-stained.  They look like they barely survived a downpour in a dusty field.  Perhaps they did.  The signs hawk the experience of seeing the hermaphrodite and hint at seeing the very thing that indicates eir nebulous gender - its genitalia.  Though you know the vice squad would be here in a second if that were true, you can't help but wonder and hope.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The chairs look about as stable as the stool.  Perhaps you'd better stand.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000923.htm">The House of Freaks</A>.
You push through the flaps to the west.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCrackling, the murmur outside gets steadily louder.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe murmur outside cracks a little, then gets quieter.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe murmur ceases, with a crackle, leaving the tent sounding hollow and too loud.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA fly bothers your ear.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear someone scuffling around outside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cat meows, then there's an insane crackle and a hiss, mechanical.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dog barks, seemingly far away and underground.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear glass clanking or smashing at some indeterminate distance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA distorted scream rings far away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the hiss of a tape recording and then a crowd cheering, faintly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA metallic shot rings out, like in a movie.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA train whistles in the distance, hissy and distorted.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear hysterical laughter somewhere nearby.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe air cracks, pops and hisses, like a bad tape recording.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sound hisses into silence, just in time for you to notice.
