&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA little old Italian lady who walks slowly, supporting herself on a cane. The hunchback 
is apparent, though the long black dress hides most of the heavy-soled boot of her 
club foot. Her long, jowled face is dolorous, her pouchy eyes shrewd, sad and faintly 
malevolent.  Her skinny talons clutch her cane as if daring you to try stealing it 
from her.
