<BR>
Eno has some things to say:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Short circuit (example; a man eating peas with the idea that they will improve his virility shovels them straight into his lap).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make an exhaustive list of everything you might do & do the last thing on the list.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Balance the consistency principle with the inconsistency principle.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Always give yourself credit for having more than personality.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Assemble some of the elements in a group and treat the group.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Look closely at the most embarrassing details & amplify them.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The most important thing is the thing most easily forgotten.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Take away the elements in order of apparent non-importance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make a blank valuable by putting it in an exquisite frame.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't be afraid of things because they're easy to do.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You don't have to be ashamed of using your own ideas.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Discover the recipes you are using and abandon them.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ask people to work against their better judgement.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Convert a melodic element into a rhythmic element.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Imagine the piece as a set of disconnected events.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp State the problem in words as clearly as possible.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Define an area as `safe' and use it as an anchor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Make a sudden, destructive unpredictable action.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Allow an easement (abandonment of stricture).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What are you really thinking about just now?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't be frightened to display your talents.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Remove specifics and convert to ambiguities.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Remove ambiguities and convert to specifics.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Are there sections?  Consider transitions.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Feed the recording back out of the medium.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Look at the order in which you do things.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't stress on thing more than another.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Go slowly all the way round the outside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Not building a wall but making a brick.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Honor thy error as a hidden intention.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mechanicalize something idiosyncratic.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What is the reality of the situation?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What mistakes did you make last time?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can only make one dot at a time.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do nothing for as long as possible.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What are the sections sections of?   
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What would your closest friend do?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Consider different fading systems.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Consult other unpromising sources.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Humanize something free of error.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Destroy the most important thing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It is quite possible (after all).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Consult other promising sources.   
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't be frightened of cliches.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Fill every beat with something.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Give way to your worst impulse.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Repetition is a form of change.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Only one element of each kind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Reevaluation (a warm feeling).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Remember those quiet evenings.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Faced with a choice, do both.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Imagine a caterpillar moving.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Question the heroic approach.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Disciplined self-indulgence.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The inconsistency principle.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do the words need changing?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp How would you have done it?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Is the information correct?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Is there something missing?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Abandon normal instruments.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Go outside.  Shut the door.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Credibility of intentions.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Listen to the quiet voice.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lost in useless territory.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Lowest common denominator.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The tape is now the music.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Towards the insignificant.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use an unacceptable color.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Work at a different speed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Infinitesimal gradations.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use `unqualified' people.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Change instrument roles.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Don't break the silence.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Simply a matter of work.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Trust in the you of now.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cut a vital connection.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Disconnect from desire.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Get your neck massaged.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Humility of intentions.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Nobility of intentions.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Emphasize differences.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Emphasize repetitions.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Overtly resist change.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp What wouldn't you do?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A line has two sides.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do something boring.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Emphasize the flaws.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You are an engineer.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A very small object.         
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Breathe more deeply.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Into the impossible.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Turn it upside down.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Always first steps.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Decorate, decorate.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Give the name away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Simple subtraction.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Think of the radio.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Children speaking.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do the washing up.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Mute and continue.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Organic machinery.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Spectrum analysis.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cluster analysis.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Children singing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Discard an axiom.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Do we need holes?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Put in earplugs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use an old idea.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use fewer notes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Twist the spine.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Tape your mouth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Destroy nothing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Distorting time.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Is it finished?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Be extravagant.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Accept advice.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ask your body.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Build bridges.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Just carry on.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Burn bridges.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Take a break.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Ghost echoes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Incorporate.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Use filters.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Idiot glee.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Its center.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Accretion.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Be dirty.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Cascades.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Reverse.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Tidy up.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Courage!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Water.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hey, my speak_msg is clear. Please set it for me!
