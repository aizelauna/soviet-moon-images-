&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLayers of delicate lady fingers absorb sprinklings of brandy and espresso. Hidden beneath is a filling of creamy marscapone cheese and shaved chocolate. The top is covered with a thick sifting of sweet cocoa and embellished with swirls of whipped cream.
<BR>
You bend over a little, breathing deeply.  The scent of the tiramisu is complex and voluptuous, hints of brandy and coffee mingling with the scent of cocoa.
<BR>
You skim a swirl of whipped cream from the top of the tiramisu, add a corner of a ladyfinger soaked in coffee and brandy and pop it into your mouth.
<BR>
You scoop a fingerful of the tiramisu and lick at the velvety chocolate, the silky filling.
<BR>
You savor a big bite mingling all the flavors and textures - the moist, delicate crumble of the ladyfingers, powdery cocoa, and slick curls of chocolate blending with the melting richness of marscapone, and the creamy cling of whipped cream.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Scattered crumbs are intoxicated with brandy.  You roll them up in a clinging ribbon of marscapone and linger over their entwined flavors.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Drizzles of espresso and brandy flavor the layers of golden pale ladyfingers.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The lushness of marscapone flows like melted silk across your tongue.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...As you eat, the thick dusting of sweet cocoa merges into the moist cake almost like frosting.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Utter opulence.  The heavy silk of the marscapone filling is perfumed with vanilla, and touched with lingering echoes of espresso and brandy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A swath of espresso lends a touch of bittersweet richness to the next bite of cake.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Shavings of dark bittersweet chocolate contrast then melt into the creaminess of the filling.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A lavish bite is saturated with flavor, the ladyfingers moist with espresso and brandy, and enriched with dark notes of bittersweet chocolate.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...A dollop of whipped cream embraces and softens all of the other flavors and textures.  You lick your lips then take another bite.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The ladyfingers give a hint of chewiness in the soft richness of the tiramisu.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You breathe in a whiff of brandy.  The sting of the liquor on your tongue accents the creaminess of the dessert.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Drunk with espresso flavored brandy, the moist crumbly ladyfingers dissolve in your mouth.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You ease out a thick curl of chocolate from the filling and let it melt slowly on your tongue.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You choose a layer of tender, delicate ladyfingers and savor their subtle sweetness.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...One bite of tiramisu is like a fine, moist cake - the next like a tipsy custard.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Delicate cake, mellifluous marscapone, dark bittersweet contrasts of espresso and chocolate, a flourish of brandy.  Is it ambrosia or an aphrodisiac?
