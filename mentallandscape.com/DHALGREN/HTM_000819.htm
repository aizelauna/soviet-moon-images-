(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000812.htm">Marcus</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOnce  this was quite a luxurious palace  for muses of acting
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and  terpsichory. Seating for hundreds  still accommodates,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp all  scuffed and torn. Plaster work in  the ceiling is vast
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp and  grand and falling. Before you the  stage, broad enough
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp for  all the Rockettes in line.
<BR>
<BR>
You find a seat not too tattered. It squeaks.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_001168.htm">Playbill</A> here.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ stage ] <A HREF="HTM_000820.htm">Stage</A>.
You mount the stage.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ southwest ] <A HREF="HTM_000161.htm">Broadway</A>.
You exit the theater and go through the lobby. You come out onto the street again.
