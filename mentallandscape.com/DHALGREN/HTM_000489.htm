&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe bright light in the right most corner reveals that the seemingly black walls are really dark green.  Surprisingly clean brown/tan paisley cloth covers the ceiling and floor.  A lone broken bottle is lying in the far left corner.  Along the east wall above the door there is a sign that says EXIT.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A lone naked wooden swinging bar at waist level says: BB CAFE

This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear two bottles becoming one.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRage Against The Machine's "Killing In The Name" resonates.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWoooosshhhhhhh.... 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Looking for a place to happen" is being played by The Tragically Hip.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomebody says, "Teenage angst has paid off well."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDinosaur Jr. starts playing "Start Choppin"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsprearviewmirror begins to play.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou think you see a bottle fall and break out of the corner of your eye.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour wrists begin to hurt from typing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"I am one" by Smashing Pumpkins is coming from the west wall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a syringe drop.
<BR>
