(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000429.htm">99</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA bare corner of un unused room. The wood floors look like they were beautiful once, but are now warped and stained. It is warm here, and there is a huge pile of old velvet drapes that make a comfortable looking nest over to one side.
<BR>
<BR>
You eye the musty pile of drapes dubiously, but since there really isn't anything else to sit on, you drop down and find a comfortable niche.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It looks like someone raided a theater or a funeral parlor, the drapes are thick, luxurious, and deep grey, albiet, dusty, motheaten, and rat-gnawed. Make yourself at home.
