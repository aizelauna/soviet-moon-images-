&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a war-chariot, square in shape, surmounted by a stared baldaquin upheld by four columns.  In this chariot and armed conqueror advances carrying a sceptre and a sword in his hands.  He is crowned with a fillet of gold ornamented at five points by three pentagrammes or golden stars.  The square chariot symbolises the work accomplished by the will which has overcome all obstacles.  The four columns supporting the starry canopy represent the four elements conquered by the Master of the sceptre and the sword.  On the square representing the front of the chariot is drawn a sphere upheld by two outstretched wings, sign of the limitless exaltation of human power in the infinity of space and time.  The crown of gold on the conqueror's head signifies the possession of intellectual illumination which gives light to all the arcana of Chance.  The three stars which decorate it at five points symbolise Power balanced by Mind and Wisdom.  Three swuares are engraved on the brest-plate: they signify rectitude of Judgement, Will and Action which gives the Power of which the breast-plate is the emblem.  The lifted sword is the sign of victory.  The sceptre, crowned by a triangle, symbol of the Spirit, by a square, symbol of Matter, and by a circle, symbol of Eternity, signifies the perpetual dominaton of the Mind over the forces of Nature.  Two sphinxes, one white, the other black, are harnessed tothe chariot.  The former symbolises Good, the latter Evil -- the one conquered, the other vanquished -- both having become the servants of the Magus who has triumphed over his ordeals.
