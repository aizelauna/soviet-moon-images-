&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on a rainingtarred roof several stories above the street.  It is surrounded by a waist-high wall, grappled by the iron railings of a fire escape leading down.  Beyond the brick balustrade, roofs and roofs checker the mist.  A gap to the north may be a park.  Beyond it is a hill, scaly with housing.  You can glimpse the bridge to the west.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeyond a skylight to the west, you see a maintenance shack, put on the roof for tool storage.  Bamboo curtains back recently puttied panes.  The door -- tar paper has ripped in one place from greyed pine -- is ajar.
