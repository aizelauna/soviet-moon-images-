<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cozy little survival shelter for postapocalyptic times. The walls are decked with tapestries and posters, the floor with thick Persian rugs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA queen-sized mattress dominates the north end of the room, and comfy burgundy throw pillows are strewn about on the floor.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIndirect light comes from a shaded clip-on lamp turned toward the east wall, next to an antique Mac Plus with a cheapo 2400 modem. A gasoline generator hums in the background. Along the south wall stretches a home-made bookcase, underneath which is a stack of comics and magazines.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA metal ladder leads up to the hatchway.
<BR>
<BR>
You sprawl lazily on the bed.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA gasoline can snaps, crackles, and pops in the flames

My Way, by Sid Vicious, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRonald Biggs sings off-key over smarmy strings: "And now ... the end is near ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGuitar strings screech and the song punks out!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSid Vicious snarls: "Regrets ... Oi've 'ad a few ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"For -- wot is a brrrrat? Wot 'as 'e got?"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSid Vicious sneers: "Oi did it mooooooooiiiy way!"
