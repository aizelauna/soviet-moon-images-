(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000296.htm">Valis</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mattress in one corner, a bulb hanging from the ceiling, a chair in the middle of the room, a window, a pile of trash in another corner.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An old aluminum-tube chair, upholstered in shiny red plastic, torn, with some yellowish foam stuffing bulging out.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A torn and frayed sheet, which has given up all hope of ever being white. An olive-green blanket wadded up at the foot. An stained, limp pillow.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A single bare bulb, hanging from the ceiling by a dangerous-looking frayed cord. There's a switchplate on the wall by the door.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A dirty, streaked, cracked pane of glass. It seems to be %daytime, and it seems to be %weather outside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A collection of empty juice bottles, crushed beer cans, food cartons, cereal boxes, newspapers, and old, worn-out clothing.
<BR>
<BR>

You pull on the door to the east, and finally manage to work it open.  You step through.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mouse skitters across the floor and vanishes through a crack in the wall.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA spider drops jerkily down a strand of web from the ceiling.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cobweb in the corner wafts in a momentary draft.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear a vague rumble from somewhere below.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe bulb suddenly dims, flickers, then brightens again.
