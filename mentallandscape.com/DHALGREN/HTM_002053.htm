&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                     Song of Bear
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspoff with her, up the mountain to the cave where the bear liv-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsped, and they went inside and they loved each other.  In the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcold winter they slept together and the bear's thick fur kept
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthem both warm, and in the springtime they came from the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcave together and danced, and fished, and were happy.  And
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe bear wrote a song for the young woman and would sing
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspto her, and the young woman was happy.  And if people talked
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspabout it, they talked about the wonder of a woman and a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbear livin' together and bein' happy, because the arrangement
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof meat and bones doesn't mean anythin'."
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  And then my Granny sang the song of the bear for me and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsaid I could write it down and share it.  Anybody who can
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfind music for this song, and sing it, or dance to it, is a sister
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspof the bears and can ask to be admitted to the Bear Clan.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd when you go in the mountains, whether it is your
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmenstrual time or not, you wear a bell, so the bears will hear
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou and know you are their friend.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 The spirit of beauty
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                   has come with me.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 The spirit of beauty
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp             has left her friends and family
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                   to come with me.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                Should her family come
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 and take her from me
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                     I would die.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 The spirit of beauty
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                     walks with me.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp             I will gather berries for her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          and tubers and roots from the hills.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp            I will bend myself to please her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp           will dance for her, keep her warm.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp               I wrote this song for her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 I sing it now for her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                 The spirit of beauty
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                   has come with me.
