&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBefore you is the bastard son of the Ninth Earl of Malquist (and as such, unable to inherit the title). Like most offspring of nobility, he shows signs of inbreeding: over-accentuated features, pale skin, and disturbing thinness. Only his mother's genes save Malquist from utter unpleasantness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMalquist wears a fur-collared, leather jacket (in the style of W.W. 1 aviators), Wellington boots, black trousers, and a white, silk shirt. There is a blue lily in the upper button-hole of his jacket. His left eye is robotic.
