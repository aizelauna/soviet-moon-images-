&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Builders of the Temple, in their infinite wisdom, wisely placed the Administration and The Trash Bin next to each other, hidden away from the rest of the Temple. Would you want such nasty, smelly things in front of your nose all the time? All sorts of lovely trash lies around here, from banana peels to old, unprocessed forms. A rather unsanitary door leads back out, to the north, which allows this room and the administration to remain in a constant mutual state of spillover.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001750.htm">Administrative Concourse</A>.
You wade your way back through the trash, out the north door.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ southeast ] <A HREF="HTM_001756.htm">Dark Tunnel</A>.
You leave through the hole in the southeast corner.
