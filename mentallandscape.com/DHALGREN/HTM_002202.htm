<H3> The Pickpocket (#2202)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_001044.htm">Generic Speaking Wandering Automaton</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_002177.htm">Avon</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA nondescript little man dressed in a tattered raincoat. His eyes, bright as polished buttons, dart about, not missing a thing. His nimble hands fidget restlessly. He looks ready to be your buddy at a warm word, and crumple at the slightest threat. His expression is perpetually hopeful.

<BR>
The Pickpocket has some things to say:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Good ol' Avon!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stealing's quicker!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Leave me a torch, I like to see what I'm scared of.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No to whatever it was.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A thief isn't what I am, it's who I am.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Avon the machine.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I don't believe in suicide, it stunts your growth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I've just worked out a completely new strategy.  It's called running away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Blake would have been proud of you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I plan to live forever - or die trying.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There isn't a lock I can't open - if I'm scared enough.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There isn't a volcano alive that would dare to swallow Avon.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Stealing is quicker.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Himalayas are quite tall at this time of year.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I never realized you felt this way about me.
