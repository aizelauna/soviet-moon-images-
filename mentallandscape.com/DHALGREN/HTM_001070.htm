&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself standing near the shore of a small volcanic island -- one of many on a mostly water-covered earth.  This is the site of Bellona, 1.5 billion years in the past.  You seem to be wearing an oxygen mask, while around you the heavy atmosphere of methane and carbon dioxide presses against your chest.  The sun is small and dim in a pinkish sky, but the air is very warm.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe dark rocky surface of the island shows no trace of life.  The sea water is a rusty brown -- something has started to generate oxygen, and dissolved iron is taking it up.  Just beneath the surface, you see pillow-sized plateaus of bluish-green matter.  Colonies of primitive algae, perhaps?  You notice the word "next" carved on a nearby rock.
