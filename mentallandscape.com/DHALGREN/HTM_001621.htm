&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large oak tree spreads its branches over a wooden kiosk covered with announcements in the grassy center of the square. Park benches line the sidewalks amidst flowery shrubs. You see the library to the northeast, the post office to the southeast, the homeless shelter to the southwest, and the hotel and convention hall to the northwest.

The doors slide apart on either side silently and you enter a crowd of tourists and frazzled businessmen trying to get there from here faster.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A translucent white disc set in the center of the street.
[ ss ] <A HREF="HTM_001641.htm">Zariski Lighthouse</A>.
You step onto the disc and rematerialize far to the south...

You creak open the door, and enter a dark, dusty, damp building.

[ southeast ] <A HREF="HTM_001696.htm">Post Office</A>.

You walk east along Government Street, ignoring the many cars zooming by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A translucent white disc set in the center of the street.
[ ee ] <A HREF="HTM_001721.htm">West of Covenant Beach</A>.
You step onto the disc and rematerialize far to the east...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A busy street leads north through office buildings and shopping centers.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001736.htm">King Street</A>.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The oak tree is old and gnarled, but its branches are still strong. They spread out over the grass like a leafy green roof.
[ climb ] <A HREF="HTM_001961.htm">Sunken Islandia</A>.
You climb the tree, bringing back childhood memories of trees past. For a moment, you sit on a branch, remembering. Climbing further, the spell is broken and you emerge from the waves and climb into your boat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look down at the street. It is littered with washed out scraps of paper and tin cans.
