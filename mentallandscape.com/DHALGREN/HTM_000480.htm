&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA rare issue 158! This one must be worth a mint! The story starts when Pugatron kidnaps SuperGuy's aunt. Pugatron exploits SuperGuy's weakness to take over the city. In the stunning cliff-hanger ending, SuperGuy seems like he is about to have his head cut off by a wood-splitting machine.
