(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_001030.htm">Generic Stone Building Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000100.htm">Dred</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAt once you sense the absence of the cold stone walls that have surrounded you thus far. Instead, the walls are covered with shelves of books from top to bottom. Free standing shelves of books stand in orderly lines in the center of the room, obscuring any sense of size. Small tables also occupy the open spaces. One with a lamp upon it shedding light. The books seem to suck in your breathing and your noise. Age emanates from them as well, but not a single bit of dust can be seen.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A smooth wooden door with a peak at the top.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001113.htm">Hallway Bend</A>.
You open the door and step into darkness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Bookcases line the eastern wall just like all the other walls.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_001119.htm">Den</A>.
You search around the bookcases and pull on a fake-looking book. The wall rotates and you step through.
