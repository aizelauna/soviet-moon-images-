&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDarkness all surrounds and permeates this place like a plague. It clings to you like spiderwebs, making your skin crawl with disgust. Your movements make no noise, which makes the silence thick and spongy.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see nothing but darkness.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001109.htm">Darkness</A>.
You steel your nerves and push further in the darkness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can't see a thing, but you can feel the smooth wood of a door and encounter a handle.

You fumble around for the handle on the door and turn it quickly. Surprisingly, the door opens and you blink at the sudden light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A dim light ahead shows a very narrow hallway.

You carefully move towards the light.
