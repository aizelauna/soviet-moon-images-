<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe statue of Chrysalis is set next to the one of Nightfall. The statue is carved 
out of a block of clear crystal, imitating her transparent skin very well. She is 
smiling, and seems to be looking right at you. Hanging on a chain around her neck 
is a small stylized arch in gold.
