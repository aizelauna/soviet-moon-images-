<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  A pink feather boa, clearly a stage property, old but
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp not so worn out that it can't be thrown over a shoulder
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  with a flourish...play with me, it seems to call, play...
<BR>
<BR>
Go to location of this object, <A HREF="HTM_000820.htm">Stage</A>.
<BR>
<BR>
After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  THE PYTHON SLITHERS ON. TWINES ABOUT.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA billion years ago, when the stars were young, the deluge came.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe waters receded. From the mud, a monstrous serpent came.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python: A gorgeous serpent, glistening in many colors.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python: Gorgeous, clever...and hungry.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  THE FOOLISH BIRD FLIES ON. STRUTS ABOUT.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: I can fly. See me! Now watch.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: Watch me swoop. Watch me hover. Watch me glide.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: Am I not exquisite? And cute & cuddly & sweet &...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: ...and, well... Fantastic?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: Hmmmm? Hey you! Pay attention.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Yes, Bird, you are amazing and fantastic. You are sumptuous.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: Ohh, what else am I? Build it!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: You are intoxicating and glorious. You have a supernatural brilliance.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Let me caress you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: MOST people want to caress me.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Come here, let me hug you. I am very wise. I can show you many things.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Come closer.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird flies around panicked.  "Oh, no!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python contorts in anger 0~~:...  then calms down.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Come I am very wise I can tell you many things. Who made the world, why there are seas and why there are kings.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Come closer and look into my ruby eyes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: Oh no, your eyes are ugly & muddy.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python contorts in anger.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird flies about.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: You Vain, Silly, Stupid Bird!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Sweet Bird, come nearer.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Let my black tongue flick over your wings.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: Oh no, Oh, no serpent! Your tongue is cold & forked.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: It cannot sing, like my lovely tongue.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: I LOATH your strange tongue.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: (I'll get this brainless, dumb bird if it's the last thing I do...)
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Sweet Bird, come let me hug you. Pretty please?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: Oh, no, oh, no, Serpent!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYes, yes, yes. You are gorgeous, amazing & sumptuous.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere she comes. A little closer. She's getting ready.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOh, no, she's not.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYes, yes, yes. Here she comes, for a little hug.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSee, she touches my muscles. And now my side. That's it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI don't know why I'm doing this.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd now my other side. Ohh, and now I touch her side, and the other side too.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOhh, and stroke my wings. Ohh, more, more.  OH...OH STOP!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird panics.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python squeezes tighter and tighter.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow, I hug my little bird, tighter & tighter & tighter.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird struggles.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python rolls.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird escapes and flies away.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python contorts in anger, hissing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird: Serpent, you will never caress me again. Never! Never! Never!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python: Ohh, gorgeous bird, you are intoxicating. You are glorious.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: I'm not listening.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Yes you are. You are an amazing & sumptuous creature.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: Really? Do you think so?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Bird preens.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Python slithers about.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPython: Oh, yes, yes. You have a supernatural brilliance. Let me caress you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: No! Well...maybe...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBird: ...just once more.  Would you stroke my wings and my lovely crest. Ohh, that's it...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOh, yes, yes, gorgeous bird...
