&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Through the pale remains of a vineyard, sun-bleached and wind-bitten, a thin wind rustles noisily. You smell a faint sea tang, kerosene, a hint of burning rubber, and snow. The frozen earth is littered with cigarette butts and small colored ceramic tiles, in no discernable order. These are semi-concealed by a glittering skin of hoar-frost.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Down the slope to the west, water glistens coldly, and a city is etched limply against the fraudulent mist rising from the river. There is a jumbled pile of wooden crates pushed together, and a red metal fuel can labled "Poison".
