&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis area of the ledge runs along the south wall; you can see the hooks that hang the southern curtain. The southern statues also stand here, leaning as if ready to dive down to the floor below. The only possible exit from here is back to the east.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ east ] <A HREF="HTM_001945.htm">On the Ledge, Eastside</A>.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ down ] <A HREF="HTM_001747.htm">Temple Entryway</A>.
Hanging carefully onto the curtains, you half climb/half slide your way back down to the floor below. Those curtains feel strangely slippery; on your way down, you notice the passageway in the southern wall that these curtains may have been meant to hide.
