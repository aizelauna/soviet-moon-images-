<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining and secure this day in Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWalking in, you instantly smell the rich warm scent of patchouli and mint tea, and you are drawn into a place as lavish as the genii's bottle.  Heavy red draperies bellow down from the center of the ceiling to the walls, piles of brocaded pillows fill the every corner, and low tables with hookahs, platters of half-eaten fruits and dates, and brass lamps squat in the periphery.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a romanticized view of Morocco, no doubt, but its exoticism reaches deep inside to a dark familiar place within yourself, the genii's bottle you keep stoppered tight.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small trip south will lead you to Tangiers.
