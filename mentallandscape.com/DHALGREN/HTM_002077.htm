&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSand and sand and still more sand. Lonely guitar riffs echo out across the beach at the endof summer. A red bench stands over to one side and you can hear the ocean pounding just past the dune. A path straggles over towards the forest which edges this beach. Rusty pails and broken pieces of plastic shovels lie in a heap where some beachcomber has piled them.
