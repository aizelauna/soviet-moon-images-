&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe walls of the tunnel drip with moisture. You can smell mold and other dank smells around you. The floor appears to be dirt-covered stone. Darkness is all around you, but you sense something off to the sides of you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWan, watery light shines down through the grate in the ceiling. You can see a doorway to the north--its frame carved with occult and mysterious symbols. A drain appears to run alongside the tunnel floor; water is moving sluggishly off to what you think is the south. Rubble blocks a tunnel mouth to the west.

You grasp for handholds on the tunnel wall and pull yourself up.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You barely make out the shadowy outline of a carved doorway to the north. As your eyes adjust to the darkness you see the doorway is carved in the shape of an archway with a crouching gryphon over the lintel. Inky darkness whirls in the center of the doorway and appears to suck what little light exists in the tunnel into its midst.

You step cautiously through the carved doorway.
