&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA scraggly-looking brown nanny goat with four horns.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">feed</A> ] feeds the brown goat some food scraps, which it gobbles down eagerly, tail spinning.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State1.htm">pet</A> ] pets the brown goat, which butts its bony head against her hand, bleating happily.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State3.htm">milk</A> ] tries to milk the brown goat, but it kicks her, making bleats of protest.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State3.htm">kick</A> ] kicks the brown goat, which responds with a sharp kick to her shin.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047_State2.htm">ignore</A> ] ignores the brown goat, which ignores her right back.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_001047.htm">woo</A> ] woos the brown goat, which doesn't seem to respond at all, other than looking at her strangely.
