&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA blue pill, with ambiguous markings.
<BR>
You gulp down a blue pill with a glass of water. It has a bitter aftertaste. You wait for something to happen. You are feeling more and more relaxed. So relaxed, in fact, that you can barely move your limbs.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are feeling more and more sleepy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Life doesn't get much better than this....
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are feeling more and more sleepy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are getting stupider by the second, but you don't care.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are feeling more and more sleepy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Your brain dissolves into a lukewarm mush.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are feeling more and more sleepy.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You forget all your ambitions, content to wallow happily in the mud.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You are feeeling more and more sleepy.
