&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA cement toadstool lawn ornament. It was once painted a cheery red with white spots. Now, graffiti, dirt, and weather have taken their toll. Rusted rebar pokes from one side where the cement has crumbled. A colony of caterpillers has taken up residence in the shade of the mouldy underside.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Fool! You were warned but you just couldn't listen could you? Sheesh. Now you're in for it. As you gaze at what should be your own familar face, beloved only by your mother, the image shifts. After a dizzying moment -- what else can you expect, afterall you're inside a toadstool and some toadstool is inside you -- a vision gains uncertain focus. Greens and blues swirl and slide into parkland and sky.
