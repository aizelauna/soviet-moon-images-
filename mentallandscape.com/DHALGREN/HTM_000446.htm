&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen Salome dances, it is something feral
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand fierce, and all the fires seem to find her.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Here," she says.  "Here is his head," holding
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher mother's finest silver plate aloft, his head
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplike some great round date, disembodied,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphard.  "Here," she smiles, moving like fire
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspitself, her body full and ripe like an avocado,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspher smile sublime and locking something in,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsomething achingly desireable, almost familiar,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthis woman with a man's head in her hands.
