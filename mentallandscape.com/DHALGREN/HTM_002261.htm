&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tiny and reeking concrete box.  The fire stairs loom in front of you, shadowed in the gloom, illuminated only by the sickly green light from the exit sign above the door. The light fixture hangs smashed from the ceiling, and you decide that you'd rather not be able to see clearly into the corners of this place, anyway.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000847.htm">Ground Floor Hallway</A>.
You struggle with the fire-door long enough to experience a moment of panic. With one final, adrenaline-powered shove, you push the door open, and step out into the comparatively bright corridor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ up ] <A HREF="HTM_002264.htm">Second Floor Landing</A>.
You make your way into the gloom towards the stairs and begin a careful ascent. You rest your hand on the mysteriously sticky handrail for balance, then immediately think better of it.
