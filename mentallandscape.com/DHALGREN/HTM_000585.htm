&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA jumble of four legs, spikes, boney body, and a head shaved bald, a figure of sharp distinction and awkard movement.  Eyes like black marbles, with no pupils, stare into nothing, or into his own heavy skull, it's impossible to tell.  In any case, he seems to be eyeing it, whatever it is he is actually looking at, with a fuzzy combination of distrust and fascination.  The ends of his paws morph slowly into the shape of human fingers, reaching out as if to grab, but never doing more than scratching dirt or helping to move him at his snail's pace along the ground.
