&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis corner of the Park is filled with closely-growing trees, birches, ash, and a few pine, which grow up to the water's edge, overhanging it. A number of cozy nooks at the roots of trees give one a place to sit, and a narrow footpath twists and meanders through the area.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Park spreads to the east and west, and the pond is to the north. To the south, through the trees, you can make out movement, and see a paved road...
