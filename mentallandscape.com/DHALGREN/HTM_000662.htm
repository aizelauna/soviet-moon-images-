&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a blazing star with eight rays surrounded by seven other stars hovering over a naked girl who pours over the barren earth the waters of universal Life that flow from two goblets, one gold the other silver.  Beside her, a butterfly is alighting on a rose.  This girl is the emblem of Hope which scatters its dew upon our saddest days.  She is naked, in order to signify that Hope remains with us when we have been bereft of everything.  Above this figure the blazing, eight-pointed start symbolises the apocalypse of Destinies enclosed by seven seals which are the seven planets, represented by the seven other stars.  The butterfly is the sign of resurrection beyond the grave.
