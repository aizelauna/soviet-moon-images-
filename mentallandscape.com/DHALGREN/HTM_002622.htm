&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt's a yellowing page ripped from a cheap paperback. "GALAXY 666" is scrawled
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspacross the top in blue ballpoint.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe things were odd, weird, grotesque. There was something horribly uncustomary and 
unwonted about them. They were completely unfamiliar. Their appearance was outlandish 
and extraordinary. There was something quite phenomenal about them. They were supernormal; 
they were unparalleled; they were unexampled. The shape of the aliens was singular 
in every respect. They were curious, odd, queer, peculiar, and fantastic, and yet 
when every adjective had been use on them, when every preternatural epithet had been 
applied to their aberrant and freakish appearance, when everything that could be 
said about such eccentric, anomalous creatures had been said, they still remained 
indescribable in any concrete terms.
