&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspI have no public struggles, no scars, no open wounds that pour bright and sore into the thick air of night. I have no fluttering eyelids, be it with pain or with its counterpart. I have no self-evident markings, no messages I bear for the world to see. I have hair the shade of wet sand in the moonlight, and eyes like eucalyptus bark: rough, dark, brown. I have a body like any other. I have jeans, specked with dust and dried up flecks of blood. I have myself.
