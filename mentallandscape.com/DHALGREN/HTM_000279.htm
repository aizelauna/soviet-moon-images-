&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a small ebony board with several pieces of fresh sea-urchin sushi on it.  Each piece is a ball of rice wrapped in a cylinder of dried kelp, then topped with a glistening, quivering blob of pale orange flesh that looks almost like custard.
<BR>
It is fresh and has just the faintest smell of the sea.
<BR>
The cool raw sea-urchin meat is slick and so soft that it literally dissolves in your mouth before you can start chewing.  It blends with the rice and has a salty subtle flavor.  As you chew, you release a small pocket of wasabi horseradish which briefly tingles your sinuses with its powerful aroma.
