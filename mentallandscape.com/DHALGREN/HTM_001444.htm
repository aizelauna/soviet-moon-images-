&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspParting a weighty avocado vinyl curtain, you ascend a narrow wooden hallway of stairs, crunching grit and shoulderbrushing the sides.  Torn pictures of Billie Holiday, Chet Baker, Joe Louis, and Sarah Vaughn stare at you in washed-out repose, peeling from the blood burgundy paint of the walls.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAfter reaching the top of the entry-way, you walk beaten stool and smeared chalkboard, pink lines listing the beers, wines, and bands of the evening.  Tables abound in all directions, each lit with a white votive candle and decorated with a butt-filled ashtray.  Seats of wood and crushed purple velvet beckon to be sat upon.  In front of you looms the sinister sexwood of the mahogany bar, beaten wood-wornblack leather stools for seats, while above adorns a bottle of Jaegermeister capped with a babydoll head.
