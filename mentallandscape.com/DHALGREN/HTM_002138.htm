<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sexy? I dunno. Just doesn't do it for me.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You know what's really sexy though? When you're like really down and pissed off at the world ... and then you hear this song you really really like ... and it makes you just want to LIVE again.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp All right, all right. Take it easy, willya?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Listen, this city's a pretty lonely place when you get right down to it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look a lot like someone I knew in eighth grade.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I wrote this song in my sleep yesterday. Then I forgot it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hey, which one was your favorite KISS solo album? And you better not say Peter Criss...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Tura Satana. Does anyone remember Tura Satana?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp So ... what did *you* do today to fight right-wing political oppression?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp No shit!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Know if there's a motor speedway around here?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You've got a funny accent. Where you from?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm totally out of it today. Must be the ozone count.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Man ... You really should do something about your hair. Like, grow it out. Or cut it.  
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hey, you're cute, y'know? Well, kinda.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This place gives me the shivers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Sorry, I just had a really cool idea for a T-shirt. What were you saying?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I gotta get to the shop sometime, get my amp fixed.
