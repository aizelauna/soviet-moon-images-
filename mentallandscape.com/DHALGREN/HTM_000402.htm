<H3> Moon Candle (#402)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000208.htm">generic candle</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000095.htm">legba</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small, silvery white candle about three inches tall, with bright glints of sliver embedded in the wax.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can't light the Moon Candle without a match. You rummage through your pockets and fortunately find one. Though it's coated with pocket lint, it flares up into a flame when you stirke it on your shoe.  You light the Moon Candle
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Moon Candle sputters and flares as the flame reaches the wax. You smell the sharp sulfur of the match and the scent of low tide as the Moon Candle burns.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe flame of the Moon Candle leaps up higher now as it burns itself halfway down.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe Moon Candle is reduced now to a small shard of silvery white wax and a bright flame.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe flame finally consumes the Moon Candle entirely and extinguishes itself. Where the Moon Candle once was, you see a small slip of paper.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA small slip of silvery white paper, a little charred at the edges.  It has some writing on it.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp On a foggy day, in a pearly light, you will meet a beggar who has some information for you. Listen carefully, but don't take it too seriously.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp If you stare at a plate of pasta just right, the semolina shapes will reveal a truth to you that's been just on the edge of your awareness for weeks.
