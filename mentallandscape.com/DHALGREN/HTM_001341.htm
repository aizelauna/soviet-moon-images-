&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself wading (or even floating) in the wonderfully cool water of the pond. The trees are far from the pond's edge, except for some which overhang it to the south, and comfortable sunlight streams down onto the water's surface. The pond is bordered by a low wall, which keeps the overhanging shore from getting muddy. In the pond with you are scattered ducks, the occasional toy boat, and a large wooden float, painted a weatherbeaten white.
