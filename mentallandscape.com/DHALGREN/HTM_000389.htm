&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDhalgren has a number of locally developed GENERIC OBJECTS that you might want to 
use.  The Generic Post-Apocalypse Room Class (PARC) is a simple implementation of 
a room with details and security.  After building a room with @dig, you can turn 
it into a PARC type room by:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @chparent here to #110
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA local enhanced player class commonly used is our Generic Scorpion Player Class 
(GSPC).  It can wear objects, and more advanced clothing features are being planned 
for it.  To become a Scorpion, type:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        @chparent me to #153
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere are some bowls of dye here.  Try wearing them and looking at yourself.  For 
example:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        take woad
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp        wear woad
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you are a guest character, these commands won't work, and you should just type 
'next' to move on to the next room.
