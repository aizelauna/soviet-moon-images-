&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is the extreme western end of Fox Terrace. You can see a large grey marble structure to the north, the Palazzo Feldhyser, which rapidly nears completion.  To the south is a verdant grove of trees, and nestled in its depths is a comfortable-looking house.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the west is The Park; Fox Terrace extends to the east, and at your feet is a glossy white stepdisc.
