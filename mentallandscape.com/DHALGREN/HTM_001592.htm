<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA nickel-plated, straight-lined, 70's-vintage diner jukebox, in near-mint condition except for a couple of bullet holes in the side.
<BR>
<BR>
My Way, by Sid Vicious, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRonald Biggs sings off-key over smarmy strings: "And now ... the end is near ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGuitar strings screech and the song punks out!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSid Vicious snarls: "Regrets ... Oi've 'ad a few ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"For -- wot is a brrrrat? Wot 'as 'e got?"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSid Vicious sneers: "Oi did it mooooooooiiiy way!"
<BR>
<BR>
AC-DC, by The Sweet, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"She's got girls ... girls all over the world ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"She's got men ... every now and then ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"AC, DC, she's got -- some other lover as well as me ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"She's got zing ... watch her move her ding-a-ling ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*loopy guitar solo*
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*whispered, over hushed instruments* "...every now and then ... but she can't make up her mind..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*full force now* "AC! DC! Someo ther lover as well as me!"
<BR>
<BR>
Black Sunshine, by White Zombie, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIggy Pop intones: "Gripping the wheels his knuckles went white with desire ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"THIS is Black Sunshine."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRob Zombie howls incompreshensibly as the heavy jam churns on in 6/4 time ...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Sweet'n the ride / Black Sunshine / Sweet'n the ride /Yeah..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou catch the words "Moon in Scorpio"...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe song pounds on into the bridge...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Sweet'n the ride ... yeah!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIggy finishes up, vocals warping into sludge ... "A concrete fascination scraping the edge of nothing ... THIS i s b  l  a  c  k  s   u   n   s   h   i   n   e."
<BR>
<BR>
Bull in the Heather, by Sonic Youth, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA taut, chipped-away guitar line, atonal and claustrophobic...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKim Gordon breathes: "Ten, twenty, thirty, forty..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust as the tension seems fit to break out, another taut guitar line intervenes, and Kim taunts, "Bettin' on the buuuul in the heather!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"thirty, forty ... tell me that you need to, sorely ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe song ends as it began, nervous and tight.
<BR>
<BR>
Under Pressure, by David Bowie with Queen, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAARGH! It's Vanilla Ice ... no, wait ... phew, it's the ORIGINAL song that bassline is from.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBowie and Freddie Mercury harmonize: "Pressure, pressing down on me, pressing down on you, no-man-has-dot (or whatever) ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"It's the terror of knowing what this world is about ... Watching some good friend screasming Let me out ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDavid and Freddie attempt to do some scat, then wisely get back to singing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp*snap* *snap* "Turned away .. from it all .. like a blind man ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspQueen rocks out! "Why can't we give love -- one more chance??"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"This is the last dance .. this is ourselves .. Under Pressure." As the song fades out, you hope Vanilla Ice paid these guys some HEAVY royalties.
<BR>
<BR>
Oh Bondage Up Yours!, by X-Ray Spex, starts playing on jukebox
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn adolescent British girl's voice declares: "Some people say little girls should be seen and not heard .. but I say .. OH BONDAGE UP YOURS! 1 2 3 4 .."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPoly Styrene screams, "Bind me tie me chain me to the wall .. I wanna be a slave to you all .."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sax seesaws back and forth as the world's youngest-looking punk band belts out the song.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou can't even understand the second verse, but that's cool.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"Oh bondage, up yours ... no bondage, no more .. " the song goes on and on ..
