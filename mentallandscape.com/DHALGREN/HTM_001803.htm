&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are in the center of a grassy meadow; topiary bushes are arranged about the gazebo at the center. You recognize two bushes as bein a unicorn and a ki-rin. This looks like a very nice place to picnic, or you can go inside the gazebo.

You leave the rose-scented atmosphere of the lovely topiary for Unicorn Point's high vantage above the foamy ocean.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The Unicorn Point Gazebo is a graceful white dome supported by twelve slender rowan wood columns and screened from open view by a white wrought iron grill.

You step into an open and airy gazebo and regard your surroundings with great curiousity. It looks almost like something out of a romance novel.
