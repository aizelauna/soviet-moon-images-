Subj: Hey You Guevera (by Milton Acorn)
<BR>

<BR>
Hey You Guevera
<BR>
It isn't fit at a Communist funeral
<BR>
To say there will be none nobler than you -
<BR>
There shall be nobler, as you if you had lived, would
<BR>
   have become nobler
<BR>
As nobility will become the property of any person,
<BR>
Born into or soon learned,
<BR>
As nobility will become a simple reflex
<BR>
Buried among emotions which will be nobler still
<BR>
And for which today we have no names....
<BR>

Subj: CHEESE
<BR>

<BR>
This is the golden age of porcupines
<BR>
Who travel faster than abs(0)
<BR>
On the painted billboard roadways
<BR>
By re-faced and de-faced adverts
<BR>
In all their two-dimensional glory
<BR>

<BR>
This is a drive-in movie ontology
<BR>

<BR>
Through a flash of grey
<BR>
We see the screen sky loom
<BR>
A flashing signal light
<BR>
Reflects pixels in the sun
<BR>
And all machine-men kisses
<BR>
Erect cyborg penises
<BR>
On the Rue d'la Porcupeek
<BR>

<BR>
Tonight.
<BR>

<BR>
So viva porcupines in silver motion
<BR>
In their tides of greenest inertia
<BR>
Whose velvetty pink undersides
<BR>
Proceed and remain, always
<BR>
In crash test runways
<BR>
In particle accelerators
<BR>
And fresh-tar freeways
<BR>

<BR>
Viva all of us trudging east
<BR>
Within the shrinking limits
<BR>
Of our city's dripping thighs
<BR>
Her warm legs of marble and stone
<BR>
Wrapped tight around our praying tongues
<BR>
Her sweating limbs, apart
<BR>
Revealing shafts of sudden light
<BR>
In the softest pink of empty wombs
<BR>
Their upward urging, always
<BR>
Into the faces
<BR>
Of downward lapping dogs
<BR>

<BR>
Viva electrical sockets
<BR>
All plugged tight
<BR>
By our hangover dreams 
<BR>
We're at the Friends and Neighbours Cafe
<BR>
On a heat-wave morning in August
<BR>
Stomach stuck beneath golden fish
<BR>
Brought amid the murky tank
<BR>
Each mouth open wide
<BR>
And their inset eyes
<BR>
All turning mad around and around
<BR>
Looking tight and back at tomorrow
<BR>
And swimming a repeat of yesterday
<BR>
And then in the morning after forever
<BR>
	-- repent
<BR>

<BR>
So tonight viva these police sirens call
<BR>
And viva our late night cigarettes and brandy
<BR>
Viva our crabapples and bayonettes
<BR>
and our barbed wire prison fences
<BR>
	erected casually around our houses
<BR>

<BR>
Long live those knotted ligaments
<BR>
and long live the twisted flesh
<BR>
Our cushions mounted by coffee cups
<BR>
and our Pilsner cans in piles and piles
<BR>

<BR>
Long live.
<BR>

<BR>
Because we're wires
<BR>
And because we're electrons
<BR>
And because we're particles in motion
<BR>
Down the streets and alleys
<BR>
And though on the checkerboard we dance
<BR>
It's in living rooms and bedrooms
<BR>
That we porcupines dive into problems
<BR>
Long ago solved by rusty velvet couches
<BR>
And pizza covered coffee tables
<BR>

<BR>
Long live.
<BR>

<BR>
And in the yard of Scotland Yard
<BR>
The guard changes daily, still
<BR>
And in the rainy blur
<BR>
Of London's smog
<BR>
The factory whistle cries
<BR>
And houses row on row, revive
<BR>
A steady impulse drives
<BR>
Now, the porcupines emerge
<BR>
And the dens lie empty
<BR>
Again
<BR>
and again, tomorrow.
<BR>

<BR>
Long live.
<BR>

<BR>
And on the streets of New York City
<BR>
A United Nations still stands
<BR>
But never stands still
<BR>
It's squarish cornered halls
<BR>
And it's lightbulb coloured windows 
<BR>
Still ringing with the constant clatter
<BR>
Of typewriters and telephones
<BR>
Repeat all day the sudden blast
<BR>
In Haiti or Havana heat
<BR>
The mounting pressure
<BR>
Of the sweat
<BR>
Continues.
<BR>

<BR>
Long live.
<BR>

<BR>
And somewhere pursued into dark
<BR>
On the streets of Leningrad
<BR>
Tonight
<BR>
In the coolest Vodka winter, still
<BR>
Ragged red flags fly unseen.
<BR>
Their stringy ends torn by rain
<BR>
Their colours blurred by snow and ice
<BR>
And the only sound remaining now
<BR>
Is the final echoes, fading fast
<BR>
Of a Red October drum
<BR>
Heard constantly
<BR>
In the steady flapping
<BR>
Of fabric in the
<BR>
Electric wind.
<BR>

<BR>
Long live.
<BR>

Subj: HELL IS VERY REAL
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1989 and he's on public access, face separating into pink and purple
<BR>
through a cheap videocam, his first time imagining an audience that in his
<BR>
mind swells to millions, then shrinks to a couple of La-Z-Boy 2 AM unemployed
<BR>
losers.
<BR>

<BR>
He thwacks the Bible hard so the pain makes sweat break out. Basement set,
<BR>
potted plant separating into green and red. Somewhere between the leatherette
<BR>
is the key to hell, the fire, the worm. The audience, blank behind the lens,
<BR>
swells, shrinks, pupillary.
<BR>

<BR>
"Hell is very real. Oh, yes, Hell is a living. Burning. Real. Place."
<BR>

<BR>
And it's not the rockribbed faith of his fathers that's saying this, no. Not 
<BR>
That Old Time Religion any more. Back in the days when the Bible hymnal and
<BR>
Farmer's Almanac were good enough for a body they didn't even need to SAY
<BR>
things like HELL IS VERY REAL. The words come out and wrap themselves around
<BR>
what's silent in the spaces: a tweedy tract written by a mealy-mouthed
<BR>
Episcopal divine; a felt banner glued together by Sunday-school teens, hung in
<BR>
the vestry, GOD IS LOVE; fucking Godspell and whole-wheat Eucharist and the
<BR>
blessing of the animals and all that seminary shit. Words wrap where they were
<BR>
never needed. A religion is only as uptodate as its latest heresy. Hellfire.
<BR>

<BR>
"Hey, uh, you're still on, y'now."
<BR>

<BR>
Mumbles the cameraman, skinny stringyhaired in regulation AV-technician flannel and dungarees. Dead air, he realizes, staring now at the monitor where he's
<BR>
been poised, quivering out of time in overlapping pink and purple. Put it on
<BR>
pause, rewind. Do the shit over.
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1969 and he's older, wiser now in a backward sort of way, closer to the
<BR>
root of the heresy and wise as a fucking serpent. He can say fuck and shit
<BR>
it's not taking the name of the Lord in vain unless you are a stone pagan who
<BR>
worships fuck and shit haha. He realized that back in 1999 when the apocalypse
<BR>
failed to come.
<BR>

<BR>
He preaches now among the hippies, him and his Jesus people in their chartreuse
<BR>
micro-bus. He's lived through the 80's, the 70's, seen how the hippies fell
<BR>
prey to Mammon, studied all that shit, read up on Gitlin and Lasch. It may
<BR>
not seem too obvious now in 1969, but Altamont, Manson are making it clear at
<BR>
any moment, boy, if you can worship Satan you can believe in him. Which is
<BR>
really all the preacher needs. These hippies aren't as mellow as their pose,
<BR>
they didn't exactly come of age in Samoa you know, there's some deep void
<BR>
beneath the macrame and serapes and if Eckankar, Reeboks and Macintosh
<BR>
computers can eventually fill it up why not the literal Word of God, the worm
<BR>
that dieth not, why can't flames and a big bronze statue with horns guffawing
<BR>
"SUCKER!!!" fill that void?
<BR>

<BR>
In deep cover, so deep he's realized there's nothing in the Literal Word of God
<BR>
against getting stoned. He and his bus and his five or six earnest non-sexual
<BR>
tambourine-banging followers descended on the campers at dusk, down the dirt
<BR>
track, past Marin dunes and pines. The code of mellow prevents the campers from
<BR>
getting too upset at the big wooden crosses dangling and the way the chicks and
<BR>
cats let on they don't like to ball. That's how the preacher slips in, under
<BR>
cover of the "hey, cool, no problem," slips in and rams his lightning rod the
<BR>
Literal Word of God up the void of these floppy muppets. Nothing square about
<BR>
it, man, it's just the way things are, and you'd better get with the end-times
<BR>
program now the Establishment's got secular and satanic, they'll cut
<BR>
your hair and you know the Selective Service card is the mark of the
<BR>
beast, you know it man.
<BR>

<BR>
Eventually the fire's the only light and the joints get rolled and passed
<BR>
around and it's like whoa, cool, you jesus freaks are all right u he heh haw
<BR>
haw. And when everybody's nice and heavy into it and some of his celibate
<BR>
magdalenes are combing through the hair of the grinning recumbent campers
<BR>
he takes a burning stick out the fire and stares at it long and calculated
<BR>
slow begins to speak.
<BR>

<BR>
"I've seen Satan, man. For real I have seen Satan."
<BR>

<BR>
Nods, nods, muffled amens. This - guy - is - stone - DEEP.
<BR>

<BR>
He fixes them all, a rapid-fire eye saccade. Receptive.
<BR>

<BR>
"Satan is very real, my man, and Hell is the ultimate bummer."
<BR>

<BR>
And so it goes, following the heresy to its roots, merging, becoming the heresy
<BR>
in order to understand what inside it will survive the literal application of
<BR>
the Word of God, what part of it can remain as cover, as options for getting
<BR>
further back, further deep, leaving behind him rewritten newspaper headlines,
<BR>
saved souls in ripples swelling heaven, a senile Hitler huddling in a bunker as
<BR>
the Japanese airforce bombs Berlin in 1969 for all he knows.
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1929, the Klan more popular than the Masons, Elks and Rotary put together in the state of Indiana. Hood thrown back in torchlight.
<BR>

<BR>
"Satan is very real. And as the Literal Word of God tells us, his emissary on
<BR>
Earth is the bloody-handed Jew ..."
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1849, overlooking Lake Cayuga by moonlight in the New York hills, bowels
<BR>
growling with their load of fruit and dietetic bran crackers. Two ladies in
<BR>
woolens, lacy edges of their divided undergarments garlanding their boot-tops,
<BR>
minds opened by his sound and congenial application of Scripture to the woman
<BR>
question, sit in the wet grass before him.
<BR>

<BR>
"And then, in my vision, the very innards of the Earth were opened unto me. And
<BR>
I saw there the place described in the Gospels, the place of the wailing and
<BR>
gnashing of teeth, where the worm is not stilled. Yes, Hell is real, good
<BR>
friends; Hell is a very real place ..."
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1689, and in lace collar and doublet he puffs tobacco from a clay pipe, in
<BR>
the common room of an Antwerp inn; arranging his manuscripts and waiting for 
<BR>
Spinoza to walk in the door.
<BR>

<BR>
"For the property of Infinite Goodness, which followeth a priori from the
<BR>
existence of the Deity (Q.E.D.), is not axiomatically incompatible with the
<BR>
punishment of Sin, conceived as having infinite extension and application to
<BR>
the Soul ..."
<BR>

<BR>
It's 1369, and he's burning at the stake beneath the northern slope of the 
<BR>
Pyrenees; the Cathars who had followed him darken the gallows all around the
<BR>
town square, and it was too early to claim he was only following the Literal
<BR>
Word of God to these fucking Papists. Shit. Just when he was making some real
<BR>
progress at the very root of the heresy, getting these love-children to clean
<BR>
up their act fornication-wise by redoubling the Last Days and Pope = Antichrist
<BR>
rhetoric until the orgasms they had from his preaching, honed to insidious
<BR>
perfection over six hundred sixty and six years, were better than the ones
<BR>
they could give each other.
<BR>

<BR>
The stake is iron. It probably won't get hot enough to burn through his bonds
<BR>
until he's dead and gone. Shit.
<BR>

<BR>
Because the heresy doesn't start/stop with the Cathars, the Waldenses and the
<BR>
Albigenses and the Brethren of the Spirit and even the crazy fucking Sufis and
<BR>
Kabbalistic Jews. Oh no. Next millennium you got the Arians and Nestorians and
<BR>
the friggin Monophysites causing grief, and then it takes a while before the
<BR>
Council of Nicaea lays down the law when Christianity isn't even Christianity,
<BR>
and the Word of God isn't even fixed, with all these bullshit Gnostic Gospels
<BR>
you've got to warn people against and these apocryphal stories of Jesus 
<BR>
as a child withering the bullies who took his lunch money, and then B.C., man,
<BR>
fucking B.C....
<BR>

<BR>
fucking hell as the burlap gown finally catches fire and his toes begin to
<BR>
blacken and peel away, FUCKING HELL, IT'S NOT REAL, NOT REAL, NOT FOR FUCKING REAL ...

<BR>
A dream. I meet my lover in a house that is not mine, with a face e does
<BR>
not know.  This house, the one that is not mine, has no mirrors.  This is
<BR>
not exactly true:  each room of this house contains one small mirror.  I
<BR>
can only see one part of myself at a time.  When I am inside this house, I
<BR>
don't know what I look like.  It amazes me how quickly I forget my own
<BR>
face.  The bits of silvered glass in this house are too small to hold me.
<BR>
I am fractured, sliced apart with thin mirror blades, keen edges that
<BR>
reflect their plunder.  A cheekbone, a ribcage, my left ankle.  The mirror
<BR>
holds my mouth when it is solemn, but not when it smiles.  There are no
<BR>
mirrors in this house to show me that I am here.  There is a rightness to
<BR>
this, because I dream that this is what my lover has seen, my body in bits
<BR>
and pieces, broken apart and distilled into text.  No pictures but words,
<BR>
no bodies but the ones we perform.  Now my lover must learn the curves and
<BR>
planes of this body of meat, because the great thumping weight of the
<BR>
presence of this body shatters the fragile web of textual knowledge, the
<BR>
body that my lover knows.  There is a strange empiricism at work here.
<BR>
It's the touchable body that is important, takes priority, matters.  The
<BR>
undeniable silky rasp of skin on skin, tangible as it is, measurable in
<BR>
pounds of pressure that your fingertips exert on my arm, calling up an
<BR>
electric jolt in my flesh that is measurable on no scale, is ephemeral.
<BR>
You touch my skin, I shiver, you move your hand away.  For seconds,
<BR>
perhaps minutes, I am left with the lingering ghost of your fingers on my
<BR>
flesh, but then that too fades and all I have is the memory of you once
<BR>
touching me, but not the sensation that made it memorable.  I have no
<BR>
record of the touch, unless you broke the barrier of my skin and left me
<BR>
with a scar, but it is the Touch that is taken for the Real.  Is this why
<BR>
my lover's hands trace my skin with a desperation that leaves ripe plum
<BR>
bruises?  Testing my outline, flatpalmed hands pressing across my flesh,
<BR>
as if worried that it will melt away into shadow at any second.  I watch
<BR>
my lover's hands on my skin, and notice that the outline of me is
<BR>
indistinct.  The familiar smoothness of my skin, the softness of hair, is
<BR>
smudged like chalk drawings melting in the rain.  I look closer, and
<BR>
discover that my flesh is separated from the air by a series of alphabetic
<BR>
characters.  This does not startle me, and I look closer, but I cannot
<BR>
read them.  I glow the eerie blue of a computer in a darkened room, and I
<BR>
cannot be sure if these letters have been written on my flesh, or if these
<BR>
letter _are_ my flesh.  My lover notices the characters at the same time I
<BR>
do, and hands press harder across my skin, molding ribs, hips, a breast,
<BR>
slow dragging fingers across my jaw and down the line of my neck.  The
<BR>
letters act just like skin, bending and yielding under the searching
<BR>
hands, the blue glow suffused with red where the hands have passed.  My
<BR>
lover's hands pause just under my sternum, rest for a moment on the soft
<BR>
skin of my abdomen, then suddenly push furiously into the text that my
<BR>
skin has become.  I watch in silence, curious to see if this will work, if
<BR>
e can break through to the skin that we both know must be beneath the
<BR>
characters.  The pressure increases, I feel the pain of expectation.  The
<BR>
letters snap, the fingers plunge through the text, punching a ragged hole
<BR>
in the page of my skin.  My lover curls fingers around the edges and peels
<BR>
away the letters.  Underneath, a keyboard.  My lover looks at me with a
<BR>
face that is a computer screen, fingers flitting across the keys of my
<BR>
organs, QWERTY caress.  I reach out and slide my textfingers across the
<BR>
smooth glass of my lover's cheek, look away and see the reflection of my
<BR>
eye in a flash of mirror.

Subj:  
<BR>

<BR>
I stand in the shower, too-hot water pouring over my cringing skin,
<BR>
reconstructing my sundered body with a fine and precise pain.  I watch my
<BR>
skin redden, and I soap my breasts, my belly, my thighs, marking out a
<BR>
self in scented bubbles.  The water defines me with small burning tongues,
<BR>
and for a moment or two I am reassured as the pain reminds me of the
<BR>
limits of my body.  This, then, is where I live.  Under the rushing water
<BR>
I close my eyes against the yawning gap that threatened to swallow me, the
<BR>
chasm between text and flesh that produces meaning in my virtual world.  I
<BR>
am coated in a clear varnish of illusion.  The pain tells me that I am
<BR>
undamaged, coherent, safe from the electronic brink that weaves itself
<BR>
around and through the self that I offer it.  It did not capture me, has
<BR>
no need to take me by force, because I have swallowed it whole.  I gag on
<BR>
the thickness of incomprehension, on the struggle to make sense out of
<BR>
something that slides through and from my fingers, drips onto my keyboard,
<BR>
runs across the computer screen that has become my third eye.  When I back
<BR>
away from the glaring swirl of text I bring it with me.  I scrub until my
<BR>
skin flames, but it will not rinse away.  The world of singlebodies is my
<BR>
Real, but the ghosts twisted together out of gleaming strings of letters
<BR>
haunt the backs of my eyelids, dancing broken and wild.  I am drugged,
<BR>
careless in my haste to step through the looking glass of my computer
<BR>
screen, my rush to waltz with these lovely text phantoms.  In my mad
<BR>
embrace, my desperate immersion, I lose the boundaries of my body, a sharp
<BR>
edge kisses my skin, and I am watching the oily slickness of fresh blood
<BR>
spill over the edges of a gash in this body's envelope.  As I lick the
<BR>
scarlet bloom from my only flesh, I am at the same time moving in a
<BR>
bloodless body, veins of text empty of the necessity of fluid.  Where can
<BR>
I find abjection here?  I weep for the loss of damage.  I once had a
<BR>
fantasy that I took the big knife, the one we use to cut the vegetables,
<BR>
and used it to split myself open from forehead to crotch, peel away the
<BR>
husk that you require for the knowing of me.  I knew success through the
<BR>
pain of surrender to the blade.  I do not know what to make of this
<BR>
violence that has replaced my escape.  It is the bloodless velvet clatter
<BR>
of my fingers sliding across the keys, throwing me mindfirst into the
<BR>
absence of a tangible self.  And I dance with beautiful ghosts, and I do
<BR>
not understand how they are you and me and the voice of the computer at
<BR>
once, and I weep for the loss of horror.  And so I build that violent gap
<BR>
into my bodies, and they come to you scarred, broken, not pretending for a
<BR>
second to understand how it is that they are themselves and they are the
<BR>
woman shuddering in the shower and they are the reflection of the me that
<BR>
you have painstakingly constructed from the filaments of text and cobwebs
<BR>
that cloud the screen of your mind's eye.

improvised in a mode with no name

composed on a scale without sound

we fold into an envelope of dizziness

navigating the rim of infinity

meticulously

generating perpetual modalities.

a fugal prison for

perfection and

Subj: mel & poly's stuff
<BR>

<BR>
These 2 sets of meditations each bring up evocative, provocative metaphors for e-contact. Me like!
<BR>
Personally, I think that mel's 2 essays are the more intriguing, because the metaphors are arranged in a narrative, deployed around an axis of theme in a way that really grips, emotionally. poly's poems are much 'lighter' in this regard; more abstract, too, playing with concepts rather than images.
<BR>
poly, are you going to fill in the missing roman numerals for us? :)

Subj: Poem: BANFIRE
<BR>

<BR>
Here's something 'Dhalgrenesque' and rather seasonable I wrote a couple of days ago. Happy Samhain! -- trism
<BR>
built a
<BR>
banfire in the
<BR>
cross of streets,
<BR>
with puddled gasoline
<BR>
on stackedup shells,
<BR>
ravaged timbers,
<BR>
burns to ban
<BR>
the traffic
<BR>
on this night of nights.
<BR>
leaves fly through the flames,
<BR>
come out as shocks of sparks.
<BR>
choking smoke obscures
<BR>
the traffic-light,
<BR>
its forlorn changes.
<BR>

<BR>
maskers, hunters roam
<BR>
the asphalt strips
<BR>
tonight, with Dian's moon
<BR>
to roust them on,
<BR>
take their steel-side prey
<BR>
with sharper arrows,
<BR>
spears set in the roadway.
<BR>

<BR>
crack the carapace,
<BR>
proceed on foot,
<BR>
it's not for tires to roll the ground
<BR>
tonight.
<BR>

<BR>
meet the antlered dancers
<BR>
at the burning heart.
<BR>
throw your metal in,
<BR>
to purify, and laugh
<BR>
abandoned at the souls
<BR>
who could not pop their locks
<BR>
and leave their seats,
<BR>
as incandescent sheets and tongues
<BR>
weld their fingers to the wheel,
<BR>
forever.

<BR>

<BR>
Vivid ginko green, body animal all, 
<BR>
your hair's too shiny, has blood, has 
<BR>
aspirin, has evening in it, muddy headstone settles &
<BR>
that summer Miya demanded peace of mind, 
<BR>

<BR>
wondered why she worried, burned her shirt with a 
<BR>
cigarette, she leaned when the aerocycles flew 
<BR>
like cold stars on a polar field, it's
<BR>
not the field of action, it's a boy thing, 
<BR>
get laid, stay cool, learn to compromise a little...
<BR>

<BR>
We were doing the fucking cherry-picker dance. 
<BR>
Lynn was along, she brought gin, we made 
<BR>
the field & river flow, it was still too cold to pick those 
<BR>
cherries, we got stoned it was wicked windy 
<BR>
when we got home, the clouds went dark & 
<BR>

<BR>
we all made it to Kyle's big stn. wagon,
<BR>
bought groceries, twelve-pack, Milk Plus 
<BR>
Six, an egg, you put on international girl singers 
<BR>
of the 60s, yr diminutive image flared 
<BR>
oracular & said you gotta wave goodbye, gotta 
<BR>

<BR>
get in touch, gotta plow the ground, gotta get the 
<BR>
car outta the ditch, gotta get a car.  Is she good 
<BR>
in bed, that Lynn Watkins.  Delerious over 
<BR>
softball asking could I do anything, did I 
<BR>
know anyone in the cemetery, could I, could you 
<BR>

<BR>
get a cheap amp, seagulls circling there veer
<BR>
thru the trees where she sat on the hood, still had
<BR>
gold streaks in her bangs bright & jeans 
<BR>
spattered bleach prismatic industries wind 
<BR>
wnw 13 mph says WKBW, woodsmoke, Colombo 
<BR>

<BR>
vanilla yogurt, yellow light century, do you 
<BR>
look like a lion, impossible blessing of bushes 
<BR>
blossoming, the pricker ones with slick black 
<BR>
branches, the cost of the greenhouse, cash 
<BR>
living, us living earshot of the bus crash.

Subj: More About Me
<BR>

<BR>
I know you're exhausted by wishes
<BR>
but it was very nice eating my bagel with your sleepy head 
<BR>
on my mind--phooey--
<BR>
I've just hung up the phone and now I'm thinking how I feel, 
<BR>
like some kind of curtain drops
<BR>
or the scenery changes every time 
<BR>
such gentle reassurances are mine to offer.  
<BR>

<BR>
It's a sign of trouble, playing alone,
<BR>
destructive and cockeyed,
<BR>
a discrete system known as the "diamond stigma."  
<BR>
It's a pillowcase, a bedspread,
<BR>
a blanket chest compressed into
<BR>
rash and bewildering bullshit, 
<BR>
I'd like to try this over again, I'm
<BR>
gaping at the wall again, I'm sure there's no interior and I
<BR>
conduct myself abominably the moment it's convenient. 
<BR>
This weird spiritual myopia makes me smile inside.
<BR>

<BR>
The point seems to be that everything is
<BR>
something else.  I want this to be a wonderful day
<BR>
but my voice is loud, rushed, unmodulated, and that 
<BR>
makes me wonder how I have these "flashes" and 
<BR>
regular words as well.  I mean that. 
<BR>
Moreover, I always 
<BR>
slow down and examine what I'm saying
<BR>
in some gloomy circular paradigm where nothing can ever stay put.  
<BR>
So I change the subject.
<BR>

<BR>
No continuity, no 
<BR>
struggle.  That's a fine attitude
<BR>
if you can express it, 
<BR>
but I speak only to those with
<BR>
whom I'm in casual contact, 
<BR>
I see the present "as is" and learn to cover it up at all costs.
<BR>
I mold my self around my tools, discreetly.

the flash of a torch

Saturday mornings

with the Lone Ranger

<BR>
paint-covered and hungover
<BR>
eating cereal
<BR>
with my three year old self
<BR>
explaining all the magic parts
<BR>

<BR>
Life is a journey
<BR>
a path of twists and turns
<BR>
I always thought
<BR>
to move away
<BR>
from that time
<BR>
its chaos
<BR>
and mess
<BR>
and now I find

rest in the warm

Prologue
<BR>

<BR>
[an empty stage, papers all over floor, chair sitting in the
<BR>
middle of the room, facing away from the audience, a person
<BR>
sitting in it, slightly slouched, talking to himself, outloud,
<BR>
frustrated]
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
writer: what i'd really like to convey:
<BR>
	the endless streets and alleyways.
<BR>
	arrange a grid throughout the city
<BR>
	crescents, concrete, without pity.
<BR>
	somehow the audience must see it so
<BR>
	a world of concrete, wind, and snow.
<BR>
 
<BR>
[in walks a dancer dressed in bright colours, does a turn around
<BR>
the stage, picks up some sheets while the writer continues to
<BR>
mumble to himself]
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
dancer: really, i think you need some cheer
<BR>
	this really has been a good year
<BR>
	the sun, it shone, the tears,
<BR>
	they're gone
<BR>
	all song and wine, without a tear
<BR>

<BR>
writer:	for you, the night is even light!
<BR>
	for you, the day is always bright!
<BR>
	tho wind may briskly cool the heat
<BR>
	you'll say: "this day,
<BR>
	it is so sweet!"
<BR>

<BR>
[in walks a businessman, carrying a brief case, listens to them
<BR>
for a bit, and then joins in]
<BR>

<BR>
man:	oh phooey on the both of you
<BR>
	cut the crap, you know it's true
<BR>
	the sun, the snow, they matter not
<BR>
	a bit of money, now that's my lot
<BR>

<BR>
writer:	you're crazy, sick, and need some help
<BR>
	your world is tangled in the kelp
<BR>
	of money, profit, loss, and gain,
<BR>
	you're causing other people's pain!
<BR>

<BR>
dancer:	not so fast, perhaps he has
<BR>
	some coins to give us, before you spaz?
<BR>
	this guy, he looks a connoseur
<BR>
	of ballerinas,
<BR>
	oh, are you sir?
<BR>

<BR>
[in walks the artist, trips over the briefcase on the floor, and
<BR>
spills his paints on some papers]
<BR>

<BR>
artist:	i say, the orange is out today!
<BR>
	the reds are violent!
<BR>
	now that's the way!
<BR>
	we need these colours, so intense...
<BR>
	[stumbles, loses the rhyme] 
<BR>
	oh dear, i think i lost my paint
<BR>
	oh, my isn't this room quite quaint
<BR>

<BR>
man:	here comes the putz,
<BR>
	i think he's nuts
<BR>
	he spent his money,
<BR>
	on paint and honey.
<BR>
	and now he begs me
<BR>
	 for my change
<BR>
	i think this man
<BR>
	 is rather strange
<BR>

<BR>
writer:	but he's a guy aft-er my heart
<BR>
	he's got his spirit in his art
<BR>
	though filled with passion,
<BR>
	he takes his time
<BR>
	to mix the colours
<BR>
	and make them rhyme
<BR>

<BR>
dancer:	artists, writers, strange indeed
<BR>
	the dancer has a different need
<BR>
	my friend, the actress, there's a girl!
<BR>
	[ sees the actress off the stage ]
<BR>
	she'll dance with me --
<BR>

<BR>
	let's do a twirl!
<BR>
	[ they dance around the stage, giggling ]
<BR>

<BR>
actress:thank you, my fans, and thank _you_ too,
<BR>
	i love you all, o yes i do
<BR>
	my arms make motions, long and tall
<BR>
	see how they have outstretched you all
<BR>

<BR>

writer:	this clown would put her actions 
<BR>
		to my text?
<BR>
	she'd screw them up, i think
<BR>
		i'm hexed!
<BR>

<BR>
man:	you'll make more money
<BR>

<BR>
actress:and i'll make it funny
<BR>

<BR>

[exit all except writer.]
<BR>

	when all around are jokes and dares

We are watching the streetlamp suns

We hang below them.

There is the wind in the sand.
<BR>
There is bread in the sky.
<BR>
In white we began to travel
<BR>
From my land into yours
<BR>
We were waylaid at the foot
<BR>
of this mountain.
<BR>
We are afraid of the day.
<BR>

Before he has promised us the Logos
<BR>
Now he has returned with the Laws
<BR>
These are the broken tablets
<BR>
He has left us with the broken tablets.

Subj: Gold Crystal Death Bus
<BR>

<BR>
Demireal hushed light of breathing.   They took my Amex away.
<BR>
I readied the noose, then thought "what a puerile reaction" --
<BR>

<BR>
& digging into the underworld I ride the gold crystal death bus, 
<BR>
purefaction,  noble gas hallway, 
<BR>
archaic blowjobs blue gleam on ebony gloss & bodies manifold-- slish--  I'd give to anything to 
<BR>
feel that... Creeping ailanthus I give you a name in the back seat, 
<BR>
the pulse an unknown highway outlined in frost, passengers all of us, 
<BR>
horizon finehammered copper in a thick  twilit line,
<BR>
death bus ticking, cooling on the shoulder,
<BR>
December grasses lucid in fog--
<BR>
Film fixed timewise--
<BR>
developments become only stillness of light unmechanical,
<BR>
steampipes, snow, palm & narcissus 
<BR>
I shed my duffle in the terminal, vast mammal house
<BR>
& still make decisions somehow
<BR>
as Mr. Dark droops in the moon barn
<BR>

<BR>
Dissolution never complete, tension flickering over surface
<BR>

<BR>
& no thinking can make you reliable, no arms
<BR>
imprison what's hovering further out at night--
<BR>
High empty maples in the sky & lumbering mountain clouds' moonlit edges,
<BR>
phantom rustle of diapers in the sauna...
<BR>
See that?   Sensational perversions gladden our hearts.
<BR>

<BR>
Six baby steps past the intersection, Super Poli-Grip:
<BR>
'that old man won't spit his teeth in the waterfall!'
<BR>
He cannot find serenity in avant-garde saloons...
<BR>
These dead  vex me, these toffees taste bad, these  dead  need a ticket 
<BR>
on the speedcrystal greyhound...

Subj: Between Memory and Dreaming
<BR>

<BR>
Someplace between memory and dreaming
<BR>
there is a room
<BR>
its only contents
<BR>
a boy
<BR>
it is a plain room
<BR>
made of bits of my spine
<BR>
flesh from my inner thighs
<BR>
the curve of my cheek
<BR>
soft and warm and drowsing
<BR>

<BR>
He sits in a plain wooden chair
<BR>
in this plain room
<BR>
this boy
<BR>
who was anything but plain
<BR>
who was everything to me
<BR>

<BR>
He flashes that sardonic grin of his
<BR>
maddening and familiar
<BR>
as he watches me
<BR>
move through my life
<BR>
my hair graying
<BR>
lines softening
<BR>
ever changing
<BR>

<BR>
He'll never change
<BR>
this memory boy of mine
<BR>
who rarely speaks now
<BR>
just watches
<BR>
a presence in my head
<BR>
now wavering
<BR>
now sharply focused
<BR>

<BR>
He has touched me only once
<BR>
this past year
<BR>
one finger probing scar tissue
<BR>
brittle like ice
<BR>
burning like fire
<BR>
his smile softening
<BR>
only when I winced
<BR>
with pleasure pain
<BR>

<BR>
I cannot evict him
<BR>
and no longer try
<BR>
he is a permanent resident
<BR>
here in this place I made
<BR>
when I was young
<BR>
my first lesson
<BR>
in the futility of loss
<BR>

Subj: Poem: THE YOUTH OF ATHENS
<BR>

<BR>
He knew it, yes, he knew just what to blame,
<BR>
or thank -- pulp-moldy patrimony,
<BR>
deep-prisoned in dad's cluttered attica,
<BR>
what did the trick.
<BR>

<BR>
All that scattershot of
<BR>
grim mass-market paperbacks, grumbling
<BR>
radaclysm of the bile-duct, spitting at
<BR>
the militarindustrial false consumer advertising
<BR>
mindcontrol the masses modernart popmusic,
<BR>

<BR>
(whether or not accompanied by
<BR>
sketchy minutopias where Man he find
<BR>
his authentixity,
<BR>
don't matter, after all who reads the Paradiso
<BR>
anyway?)
<BR>

<BR>
Now in nineteen-nightmare, it's one youth
<BR>
who feels the weight descend and crown him heir
<BR>
anachronistic to that crabbed appendix
<BR>
of the countercult, a 70s timecap,
<BR>
malcontents to wit:
<BR>
Rand and Skinner nobbing hobbes with Marx,
<BR>
Future Shock, the Greening of America,
<BR>
the Screwing of the Average Guy, Subliminal
<BR>
Sexploitation, yes, all out-of-date
<BR>
in their particulars, but still --
<BR>

<BR>
the Attitude! So he began to think,
<BR>
to scorn all that he'd previously scorned
<BR>
in a new way. All institutions can be made
<BR>
analogous unto the Church of Rome
<BR>

<BR>
(&scribbled in his highschool notebook
<BR>
FOOTBALL CAPTAIN = POPE & CHEERLEADERS
<BR>
HIS NUNS OR TEMPLE WHORES / PEP RALLY =
<BR>
AUTO DA FE etc.),
<BR>

<BR>
and Rome of course
<BR>
a short step from the primitive,
<BR>
the animal, a fertile source
<BR>
of scientist disdain for mating rites,
<BR>
for social cliques, for words of bond.
<BR>

<BR>
What's left? Among the burnout of his nights,
<BR>
no help from dreams he dare not inspect,
<BR>
Truth comes and fucks him till he screams,
<BR>
and then he runs a way
<BR>
to programmed likenesses of girls he knows
<BR>
wherepon he masters them, as man does beast.
<BR>

<BR>
He sometimes writes a poem to celebrate
<BR>
himself, his suffering in the cause,
<BR>
like that one the other day about
<BR>
Prometheus; but no, it's all the other
<BR>
way around, it's all a be-cause for his
<BR>
suffering, the bombast never sticks
<BR>
to his abhorred ego; then he does what he
<BR>
does best, with lust. He hates, and
<BR>
burns the words he wrote to cinders.
<BR>

<BR>
Not his own. Corrupted, like a puppet,
<BR>
this is why he never goes so far
<BR>
as to burn down the living objects,
<BR>
school, schoolmates, or teachers,
<BR>
church and state -- revolution
<BR>
starts at home, if you are not
<BR>
yourself, it's best to take the hemlock
<BR>
when it's relatively fresh.

Subj: Snow White
<BR>

<BR>
Puddle of light spilling out of the back door.  Blue silk kimono pulled tight around her waist, bare feet shoved into hiking boots and she's out.  She stands in the middle of the cold white snow after midnight yard, head thrown back, mouth open to catch the flakes which dance in the air around her.  All the world has gone dead quiet under its blanket of purest softest light.
<BR>

<BR>
The cats stand at the top of the back steps and look at her as if she's gone mad, dancing there in this cold wet stuff they will not deign to touch with their elegant paws.  She laughs to see them, looking so haughty there in the light, their dignity wrapped as tightly around them as her robe.
<BR>

<BR>
Her skin is still warm from her bath and steams where the large luminescent flakes touch it.  Flakes lying on her hair, on her robe, on her arms like feathers from some incredibly huge and magical bird, or the detritus of a giants' pillowfight.  She stops her dancing to stand, very quiet and still -- the yard, transformed from its normal state into something so painfully beautiful she can hardly bear to look at it.
<BR>

<BR>
She remembers doing this as a little girl -- spinning in the rare Southern snow, her white go-go boots and coat and hat all securely fastened to keep her warm and dry, her mother standing at the back door to make sure she was safe.  There was never enough snow to make a respectable snowman.  Once her boy cousins tried to make one out of mud they covered with a layer of snow frosting, but all the glazing melted and there was nothing left but a pile of mud in the middle of the yard, slightly misshapen and forlorn.  Ice was the usual winter event of her girlhood.  Ice, diamond hard and brilliant, trees and power lines breaking under the sheer weight of their coating, cars and people sliding into disaster with every move.  Not like the soft blankets of snow that lie so quiet on everything they touch, the night's dark brightened by the clean white.
<BR>

<BR>
There was snow in the mountains near Taos and she climbed out of a hot tub to roll, naked and shivering, skin burning, her lover laughing at her bareassed audacity -- he too chickenshit to brave the fire of snow on hot skin.  His laughter stopped her rolling and she climbed, sedately, back into the tub to sit properly again, hands folded.  This failure to roll in the snow was a metaphor for their relationship -- she always running headlong into intensity and he holding back, mockingly waiting for her to grow out of all the things he said he loved about her.
<BR>

<BR>
On this night she is blissfully alone, no one waits inside her house to judge her silliness.  She has never felt as free as she does in this moment, standing in her backyard, snow falling all around her.  She smiles to herself and drops her robe to the ground, pulls her feet out of her boots and falls backwards, making a perfect snow angel, marred only by the print of her ass. Clambering out of the angel carefully so as not to ruin it she laughs and laughs and falls again, makes an entire choir of angels, stark naked in the after midnight alone and quiet of her very own world.
<BR>

<BR>
Snow falling harder now, surrounding her, and she is beginning to shiver, teeth chattering, skin goosepimpling.  One last look at her angels and she gathers her clothing and runs lightly up the steps into the house, tripping over indignant cats on her way back to the bath and a cigarette before dreaming.

Subj: Driving
<BR>

<BR>
Driving through the long black night, moon sliding behind clouds and the sky is the color of the road is the color of the sky until I can't find where one starts and the other stops and I'm watching the moon and stars outside your window and stealing looks at you, reaching over to stroke the back of your neck with my fingertips to hear you sigh and feel your skin twitch and come alive under my touch.  Between-station radio static and out-of-state weather reports and late-night DJs selling songs I haven't heard since high school and the car reeks of sex and our words drip with sex and I am covered with you.  You are everywhere, your smell clinging to my skin which burns in all the places you have touched and aches in all the places you haven't touched since we met, eyes shining with anticipation of that quick fuck in the parking lot that only put more edge on the tension sparking between us like a lightening storm.
<BR>

<BR>
Stopping for a quick smoke in the cold dark of a rest area where truckers park to sleep away a few hours before heading off into whatever night they have invented for themselves and I am watching you throw stones onto the roof of the picnic shelter watching me smoke and shiver in the cold, the end of my cigarette glowing and smoke curling out of my mouth and into the air.  Stepped out my smoke and you are hard against me and I am hard against you and the car is hard against my back and we are all mouths and tongues and crashing teeth and cold fingers straining through fabric to get at warm skin.
<BR>

<BR>
The night is all gasps and whispers and the urgency of flesh which hasn't touched flesh in months.  Your fingers find my nipples and pinch and pull until I ache with wanting you, my cunt grinding against your cock, my tongue fucking your mouth with all the words I've lost in this moment when all that matters is how you feel against me.  You raise my skirt, fingers stroking my clit as my fingers stroke your cock as our mouths suck and bite lips that are bruised and swollen and then I raise my knee and you are inside me pushing and straining and we are whispering in the dark:  Come for me.  Fuck me harder.  God, I want to feel you come.  Fuck me.  Please.  Yes.
<BR>

<BR>
Your face is buried in my shoulder and when you come your teeth bruise my skin with sharp pleasurepain that sends me over the edge, breath ragged and heart pounding, cunt clamping down around your cock as my fingers dig into your back.  Smiling and laughing and kissing we hold each other and adjust clothing in the cold eye of passing headlights on the road behind us which stretches out towards the promise of a borrowed bed at the end of several more hours of driving and at least one polite conversation with the friend who waits awake in the long night to let us in.

<BR>
And busily, the silverware shines,
<BR>
Over a figure, who in a street is lined,
<BR>
By concrete chips and sheets of ice,
<BR>
His bus' further engines roar
<BR>
Among some fire hydrants ground
<BR>
And parking lots of crisping white
<BR>
His reddened cheeks & a glancing cough
<BR>
In torn coat and a borrowed scarf.
<BR>

<BR>
O astonishment, and tea galore,
<BR>
In my blood the vacuum really moves,
<BR>
So fluids upward flow, they progress --
<BR>
Thus my feet are drained, and I am
<BR>
Stuck, with these veins un-swell,
<BR>
For tonight  the cabin pressure
<BR>
Drops so low -- I am without air,
<BR>
And bursting red, I grow lightheaded --
<BR>
Breathe deep, now ye are in outer space.
<BR>

<BR>
My broken tendons, severed back,
<BR>
Your fingers in my twisted sack,
<BR>
Of bones, I reek of cigarettes,
<BR>
I walk the moon in spraining legs --
<BR>
A craft or rocket, I am neither ready
<BR>
To reach that sky, that lays below me, 
<BR>
I must be sleeping there, 
<BR>

<BR>
An invertebrate worm,
<BR>
Awaking lost, beneath a sign
<BR>
"All hands on deck," -- 	Oh ye of little faith,
<BR>
This street we walks, I am served
<BR>
The bodies shuffle -- busses roar, 	Oh God
<BR>
Why have you forsaken me?	My books remain
<BR>
Full of fairies, castles, trolls,
<BR>
While I marry such an elf
<BR>
Within my skull, that I am forced again
<BR>
To lay down conditions
<BR>
For yet another
<BR>
Unconditional surrender.

EARTHLY DELIGHTS
<BR>

<BR>
a white lad of twelve in Kenosha, Wisconsin
<BR>
enchanted by prints of Hieronymus gardens
<BR>
blankets the windows and makes known a LOVIN
<BR>
(parents away on their own fornications)
<BR>

<BR>
his stringy-haired cohorts from wood shop and Scout Troop,
<BR>
some mysterious lasses from Talented and Gifted,
<BR>
speak easy and enter, in redlight and strobeflash
<BR>
strip and inhale from a brimming tin cauldron
<BR>

<BR>
widdershins dance under mad old Led Zeppelin
<BR>
the sallow flesh colors to seeded red berry,
<BR>
calibans pipe, maenads hide in the curtains
<BR>
the wriggle's gone meaningless, life ornamental
<BR>

<BR>
i wink the TV past -- its "live from Kenosha"
<BR>
a coffle of children, in orange and handcuffs
<BR>
bows out of the house, past a gantlet of newscrews
<BR>
with millions of children, unsupervised, watching
<BR>

<BR>
new channel: a man with a corporatist mission
<BR>
"we must all pull together, both worker and management"
<BR>
he loudly denies that the classes should struggle
<BR>
and peddles a pamphlet called "Aren't We America?"
<BR>

<BR>
ah Sony I'll miss you, I'll wet a white tissue,
<BR>
the shards of your screen will I gladly recycle,
<BR>
I'll shingle some wings, and their sharp overlapping
<BR>
will cleave the air, take me to one place at random
<BR>

<BR>
I clear the flat tarmac, set down on the sidewalk,
<BR>
I check my location, and walk past a clearing,
<BR>
the windows are muffled, I press the right buzzer
<BR>
a naked lad opens, behind him, red strobing.

<BR>

<BR>
Each stroke a promise, slick upward slide scraping against everything you
<BR>
ever said to me.  Eyes straining inward half-lidded looking for a flat
<BR>
black plateau and it's almost your touch, harder, but your softness was
<BR>
always a lie.  The water is too hot, hot that makes you shout and back
<BR>
away from my steaming skin, but the boiling needles turn my mouth into
<BR>
something like a smile.  If I stand on my toes, I can see my face, a
<BR>
fog-ghost in your shaving mirror.  The steam smeared across the shine
<BR>
blurs deliberation clear and delicate, thin plum-skin gloss laid slick
<BR>
across my bones.  Alone with my skin inside this fire your traces teach me
<BR>
where I slam into the world closed by the hammering of your heart as you
<BR>
count your need across my carefully numbered ribs.  My eyes are strange
<BR>
and wide, sucked into the pure wake of the blade, all there is.  I pare
<BR>
myself precisely, but my legs are not long enough, they are slippery and
<BR>
my thighs slide whispering spangled secrets together over the curves of my
<BR>
calves, but they are not enough, I am still too far away.  I absently
<BR>
consider my fist, the bones of my fingers curled thin and angular, the
<BR>
scar on my knuckle from the heat I was told not to touch.  I prefer cuts
<BR>
to burns, blood to blisters, and with each bruise my skin shivers
<BR>
resentfully, red loosened but trapped silent inside.  I think about this
<BR>
and I think about you behind restless dreams of heavy desire and I do not
<BR>
have to guide the blade as it peels me in a solitary rhythm.  Soon I shine
<BR>
like marble in the wet and the water drinks insistently the crimson drops
<BR>
that dance from sharp kisses on the hip-jut of bones up from the curve of
<BR>
my belly, on the pale sweep where the blue map of my wrist begins, around
<BR>
the edges of the skin-hollow where my ribs cage together shadowed under my
<BR>
breasts.  This shallow sting is my secret warpaint, and I laugh with the
<BR>
razor that slices me out of your dull purple ache, wash of steel across my
<BR>
swollen lips and we are lovers indistinct in your silver eye, coming to
<BR>
kiss you back to sleep.

the rain was coming down softly and i was thinking of you, my body in oregon, yours in arizona, but our souls lost somewhere between...  i was walking up the puddle strewn lane, the same lane that i'd walked a thousand years ago with another man... but this time, i was walking with you.  i could feel you beside me... did you dream of walking with me?  i pictured you with long cape and officer's boots, so tall, walking beside me, head down, afraid to look over at me at first, afraid to admit i was real... after a while, i took your arm and we walked on in silence, the rain falling all around us, sighing against branches and rooftops... we did not speak... we did not need to...  the lanes are eclectic:  now a well kept garden, now a trash pile, a dog barking, a tree in bloom, the bitter smell of urine mixing with the cleansing rain, and on we walked, not needing to say anything, not wanting to disturb the perfect silence, each wrapped in their own thoughts, separate but the same... i thought of you, i thought of leaving him for you (i did not take your desires into account, you were the perfect fantasy with your desires reflecting only my own)... i thought of being in bed all day, i thought of fighting... i thought it would never work...  we move in different circles in real life, but in cyberspace we are soulmates, we each desperately need something that the other has...what is it that you have that i need so badly?  what is it that you bring to me? as i approached the downtown the car exhaust mixed with the rain and you blessedly stopped haunting my thoughts for a full five minutes... but as i went home again, i found you waiting by the lane, waiting to take me there... you told me you would never come, would never meet me, but you would always be with me... you told me we had the perfect relationship, the lines of communication open... you told me that if i met you i would no longer like you, but would be disappointed... i told you that would never happen, couldn't happen, that i would take you any way i could get you but you said no... we would no longer be *we* if we met...you looked deeply into my eyes and told me we were only electrons... cells are irrelevant... my heart cried MIN and it echoed down the lane and into the mountains...the echoed returned I am not Min...I am who you make me.  you disappeared into the mist when i turned the corner towards home...you promised your return in cyberspace...you told me i was a fool, you told me i take it all too seriously...you told me that you wanted me too, that i made you happy, that you wanted me wanted me in your bed in your head but never in your home.  it's a new kind of relationship for me..be gentle with me, for i am fragile and dependent...you promised me you would hold me safe, small grey bird in the palm of your hand and i trusted you and made my nest there of fragile hopes and tenuous dreams

Subj: Conversation Without Words
<BR>

<BR>
I reach out and touch your hair because I can because you're here because it's beautiful and feels so silky underneath my fingertips because it's yours because you let me.  All this long night of talking talking talking, the ashtray next to me piled with butts, the room smelling of cigarette smoke and the tangerines you drove across country to bring to me and I am running out of words.  I've been watching your hair fall into your eyes, watching your hand sweep it back from your face, and in my drowsy state I want to know what your fingers have been feeling -- so I reach out and touch your hair, my fingers brushing it back from your face, snagging slightly in the tangles, my eyes caught in your eyes which are smiling back at me and the room is silent for the first time in hours.  I can feel myself starting to blush, heat rising from my chest to enflame my face, but you capture my hand in yours and kiss the inside of my wrist, your tongue tracing the pulse that beats there and now heat is rising for different reasons and all the thousands of words we've spoken come down to the feel of your skin against mine.  It's funny how in the end there is always this one moment of anticipation when there's nothing left to say with words and bodies take over to finish the conversation.  And your mouth, which spills those beautiful words into my ears, is warm and alive against my pulse which is racing now.  I cannot take my hand back.  I have nothing left to say.
<BR>

<BR>
You squeeze my hand in yours and lay my palm against your chest so I can feel your heart beating as fast as mine, blood and pulse moving underneath the thin layer of warmth that is your skin.  I close my eyes to hide myself from you, but your lips are on mine, mouth soft and warm, and when your tongue slides inside to touch mine I know I am discovered in the way that my mouth opens to let you in, the way my tongue meets yours, the way my body leans to feel you against me (hearts beating, chest-to-chest).  You are smiling and kissing me and smiling and tonguing my ear and smiling and whispering your breath into my mouth and smiling and unbuttoning my shirt and smiling and capturing my nipple in your mouth rolling it with your tongue and teeth and my hands are in your hair again because there is nowhere else for them to go and heat is rising between us like an August day.
<BR>

<BR>
You (gently, ever-so-gently) lay the length of your body against mine, my head cushioned in the palm of your hand and I open myself to the warmth of your fingers sliding underneath my skirt to stroke my thighs, muscles quivering and jumping when your fingers stroke my wetness through the thin layer of silk which covers me.  You cup me with your hand and then slide off skirt and panties and there is the feel of cold air on warm skin and your finger sliding inside me, moving easily through the folds of skin and wet to probe desire and heat which is still rising rising in the room which is filled only with the sound of our breath and the smell of sex and emotion lying thick all around us.
<BR>

<BR>
I can feel the ache your finger leaves as you bring it to your mouth, sucking me off the tip, your eyes still smiling into mine as you bend to let me taste myself on your mouth which travels down my skin, tongue and teeth alternately circling and nipping.  I raise my hands above my head, arch my body underneath your, and try to remember what breathing is when your tongue strokes my labia, circles my clit, enters me -- your hands helping me spread my legs, helping me open to you, helping me want the feel of you against me.  Two fingers (then three) slide inside me, stroking in and out and in and out while your tongue presses against my clit and I don't need your help anymore, need only this feeling of you on me.  You slide your fingers out of my cunt and into my ass, tongue circling and flicking and circling my clit, fingers stroking me, tongue circling and flicking and I can feel the tension rising, know the instant before I fall, gasping for breath and calling your name in the warm dark.

Subj: Body Talk
<BR>

<BR>
Too many people own too many pieces of me.  I give myself away too freely like some surreal K-Mart Bluelight Special -- pieces of me, 5 for $1.  Buy one, get one free.  I am simultaneously mother, lover, ex-wife, director, poet, secretary, net denizen, daughter, granddaughter, niece, cousin, friend, co-worker, confidante, and on and one endlessly.  My body is bound by a fine web of silver wire which connects me to all the people who have rights over me.  It is beautiful, this web, glittering when I move, but it tears my flesh if I move too quickly and I fear that one day everyone will pull their thread at once and I will be cut into a million bloody ribbons.  Somewhere in the center of this net I sit inside the amber that is made up of my rage, my fear, my loneliness, my need, my desire, my grief, my regret, and all the thousands of other pieces of blackness that I lock away to finger in silence.
<BR>

<BR>
I am expert at taking my darkness out on my flesh.  I tear at my cuticles until they bleed and my son asks where Mommy got her owie.  (Mommy gave it to herself, sweetie).  I rarely sleep.  I don't eat enough on too many days and find myself late in the night, hands shaking from low blood sugar, guzzling orange juice to bring my body back into some semblance of normality.  I smoke as much as I humanly can in a day, lighting cigarette after cigarette on into the wee hours of the morning -- piles of butts and ash and dead matches growing on the table next to me.  I have at various times in mylife abused alcohol and assorted drugs, played with knives and fire, been involved with men who beat me or who ignored my emotional needs because they just weren't tidy enough.  I am possessed by a rage that frightens me in its intensity, stepping into confrontation as if my small frame contained the soul of some 8 foot tall warrior who is beating against my flesh to get out.
<BR>

<BR>
I mark my life's journey on my body -- each pierce a physical symbol of some step I've taken.  I've pierced lobes and cartilege and most recently a nipple -- threading 12 gauge wire through tender flesh and it hurt so good; pain I rode like flames and that unbelievable euphoria that comes from the combination of endorphins and terror overcome.  It is a way of taking myself back for myself, possessing my body by force, remembering I am alive and can feel something more tangible than these words that clamour for attention in my head and spill out onto the page when I least expect it.
<BR>

<BR>
I wear my self-inflicted scars like badges of honor, let my lover bite me so hard the skin turns purple where his mouth has been.  I would let him draw blood if he would.  I treasure these marks because I can never get him close enough, can't hold him long enough.  They are tangible proof he's been here in the same way the stretchmarks and episiotomy scars I earned from pregnancy and childbirth are tangible proof my son once grew inside my body; tangible proof in the same way my ragged nails and cuticles mark my stress; tangible proof in the same way the wire I push through flesh marks my need to overcome fear and the pleasure there is in pain -- tangible proof that I can bear anything.

<BR>
Ice broke branches and made the streets slick and dangerous all that winter, piled as thick as these words I pile, one on top of the other, in an attempt to tease you out of the corner in my head where you've crouched in not-quite silence for so long.  I've always given the barest facts of you:  first love, 17, rolled your car, dead, depression, life goes on.  These are parts of you I can easily state and contain, numb to the facts of it all as I am, given long practice at icing over that particular wound so the itching doesn't drive me insane.
<BR>

<BR>
Ice broke branches and made the streets slick and dangerous all that winter, and even though you died in summer it's the winter I remember best -- sliding through small-town streets in the passenger seat of your car, windows down to catch the icy air on our skin.  All that laughter we spilled out into the nights in front of fires made from logs some one of us stole off of some unsuspecting neighbor's front porch and kindling we wandred drunkenly into the woods to gather.  Fires to warm and us and keep us safe from the dark, light and heat to mask adolescent confusion.  Of all of us, you always gathered the best wood, managing to find the driest pieces when nothing dry was available.  I used to wonder if you stockpiled it in some secret hiding place you never shared, except you shared everything of yourself and I could never imagine you holding even that back.  I remember kneeling with kitchen matches and scraps of paper, striking a match off my ass and slowly nurturing that small flame into a blaze.  It's a talent I discovered with you, this ability to make light and heat where there had been none, and I'll never forget the sense of power it gave me to see flames I set dance high all around us.
<BR>

<BR>
You were always so completely fearless, frightening in your reckless abandon and intensity for living.  I remember watching you climb the water tower ahead of all of us, hands barely skimming the handrails before you stepped onto the platform and leaned your long frame over the edge, further than I ever dared.  You would do anything, say anything, be anything and the fact that one day you turned to me and spoke words of love and need was a source of such bewilderment to me in my battered antique hats and boots and bluejeans; books of poetry spilling out of my backpack and pre-rolled joints filling the silver cigarette case in my hip pocket.  You were wild and free and completely connected to the physical and I was all sharp edges and intellectual intensity and hidden words and images I hadn't mastered yet.  I've always wondered what you saw when you looked at me, always wondered why of all your lovers I was the constant, always wondered why you gave me all you did.  You were such a mystery to everyone who knew you, yet you seemed so clear to me -- this wild, reckless boy who was living harder and faster than anyone we'd ever known, devouring your life with greed and joy and a strange sort of grace I've never met again even all these years later.
<BR>

<BR>
You drove me to your family's cabin in the woods that winter.  Long weekend free of rules and parents and we slept in front of the fire, you curled around me and holding me closer than anyone had ever held me before; your hands strong and lean, your legs capturing mine, your breath slow and soft in my ear as you dreamed whatever dreams you dreamed.  We thought we had forever in that arrogance that only adolescents have when you know absolutely that you are immortal and life will give you whatever you choose to take.
<BR>

<BR>
I knew you were dead before anyone ever said the words out loud to me; knew it in the timbre of the ringing phone I hoped no one would answer.  Smell of hospital corridors and the adult world which swallowed you whole and kept us from you because we weren't family -- as if family were some wholly quantifiable entity based only on ties of blood and shared last name.  Sun beating down on me at the side of your grave and all those eyes I could never escape, spectators watching me in my weakest moment, feeding on tragedy like ticks swollen with blood on the side of an old hound dog.  Grief is the cruelest emotion, unmasking me in its power over me, taking all my strength away, shredding me of dignity, exposing me for the coward that I am.  Pain like a knife twisted in my heart; pain like a knife that never cuts, only mangles and leaves hard scar tissue in its wake that I probe with one finger every now and then to see if it's still there, and oh-yes (sharp intake of breath) it's there.
<BR>

<BR>
Ice broke branches and made the streets slick that winter, but it was the summer thaw that killed us in the end.  You crouch inside my head, permanently young, permanently beautiful, permanently owner of that girl I'll never be again.  I hated you for leaving without saying goodbye, hated you for dying before we had a chance to live, hated you for making me love you. I'll never be comfortable in love again, never cease waiting for the people I love to leave me.  Lesson I learned too young -- that people always leave and nothing but winter ice and summer sunshine remain.

Subj: Bittersweet
<BR>

<BR>
If she sent him a sprig of golden-yellow bittersweet, would he take her meaning?  Would he remember the way her fingertips felt on his skin, the salty-sweet taste of her on his tongue?  Would he want that fragile instant after the lightening passes when the smell of ozone and the feel of warm rain is all there is?
<BR>

<BR>
The spot on her street where he parked his car has been empty since he left.  The neighbors are marking his absence for her.  The cat prowls the house looking for him, meowing accusingly at her for chasing away a new-found friend.  Her bed got larger and lonelier and she added more blankets to chase away the chill; wakes up mornings tangled in the sheets from dreams and silences.
<BR>

<BR>
He is burned onto the insides of her eyelids -- blonde hair spilled across her pillows, eyes so wide and blue, lower lip bitten between strong white teeth.  She finds traces of him everywhere.  Her pillows smell like him and when she shines the lamp on her bed she finds long blonde hairs gleaming up at her in the light.  Traces of him in the clash of silver rings on her fingers and the soreness of well-used muscle.  Traces of him in half-remembered smiles and the echoes of conversation and books out of order on her shelves.
<BR>

<BR>
Something new and fragile was created in that space between them that they filled with words and laughter and touch and silence.  They try not to finger it too much for fear it will shatter, but its textures attract their fingertips like beach glass smoothed over by the tide.  If they hold it gently in their hands it will warm them like a kiss on the palm, mark them like teeth buried in smooth skin (its edges aren't quite worn down, you see).
<BR>

<BR>
They are dancing slowly and delicately in intricate circles of discovery, peeling back the layers of who they are like experienced strippers who know the audience paid the price of admission for the tease, not for the nakedness at the end.  They are careful not to burn each other in all the familiar practiced ways of burning they each know in intimate detail.  They are slow and quiet and move gently for fear of startling one another into flight through the high grass.
<BR>

<BR>
It's raining where she lives and she turns the heat back on, the gray city mirroring her moods too well; oily puddles reflecting up at her from the sidewalk where she walks on the way to the bus and the responsibilities of day-to-day life in the adult world.  She held him in her arms not so long ago, wrapped him all around herself in the quiet stillness of a night that wasn't long enough.  If she sent him a sprig of golden-yellow bittersweet, she wonders, would he take her meaning?  Smiling to herself, she thinks he would.

Subj: a motive
<BR>

<BR>

<BR>
Crave.  We frame our lackings
<BR>
and subtractions so forcefully.
<BR>
We dig craters around a pockmark
<BR>
to prove absence.  We pour the
<BR>
sand of existence through the
<BR>
tiny neck of desire, sometimes
<BR>
just to watch it go.
<BR>

<BR>
There is no pleasure in answering a
<BR>
desire quite like the slow drowning.
<BR>
Call out for a savior, standing in the
<BR>
sand; watch the tide of anticipation
<BR>
gather and begin to advance. Lapping
<BR>
and retreating. Slow consumption just
<BR>
as planned.
<BR>

<BR>
A scavenger, I uncover things.
<BR>
Meet a whim or desperate need,
<BR>
a simple distraction of ecstasy,
<BR>
in exchange for my own feast and
<BR>
plunder.
<BR>

<BR>
So few barter for the wait, angry
<BR>
demands, sooner now, but the delay
<BR>
is exquisite, the delivery merely
<BR>
accomplished. This is the theater
<BR>
of desire. An act, a stage, play.
<BR>
All ignored, deliver my desire.
<BR>
But just so, just so I can't tell.
<BR>

Subj: Dinner and Dancing
<BR>

<BR>
Desire is a dance
<BR>
we execute
<BR>
with practiced skill
<BR>

<BR>
At dinner
<BR>
we have
<BR>
careful hands
<BR>
careful eyes
<BR>
careful conversation
<BR>
we are careful
<BR>
not to touch
<BR>

<BR>
We ride the trajectory
<BR>
of this current
<BR>
with grace and ease
<BR>
holding fast
<BR>
to the edge of the wave
<BR>
so as not to drown
<BR>
too soon
<BR>

<BR>
There is a moment
<BR>
when denial
<BR>
is still possible
<BR>
and we crouch
<BR>
in that instant
<BR>
carefully
<BR>

<BR>
What was
<BR>
before
<BR>
what will be
<BR>
after
<BR>
can be no sweeter
<BR>
than that
<BR>
anticipation
<BR>
of possibilities
