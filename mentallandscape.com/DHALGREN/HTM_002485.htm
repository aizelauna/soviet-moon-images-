&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn old derelict who has somehow found his way in here.  He wears a ratty tweed jacket whose elbow patches flap like vestigial wings, and he drinks in turns from a bottle of Happy's vodka and a Schlitz tall-boy which he keeps holstered in his pockets.  His hair is a thin white tempest on top of his lean, jerky frame, andd he waves his arms around unpredictably, his long fingers twitching as his red-rimmed eyes peer at you.  He's really a nice loony:  he's just adrift in his own universe.
