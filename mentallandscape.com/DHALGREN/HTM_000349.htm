&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCalcite crystals cover the walls of the chamber, catching the light and sparking.  A heavy knotted hemp rope hangs from a hole in the ceiling high above, and you smell fresh air wafting in from a narrow passage to the east.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe signs here explain how to set the gender and description of your character.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The chamber narrows to a passageway to the east.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_000343.htm">Cave Entrance</A>.
You climb through a dark passway and walk towards a light ahead.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A rope snakes up into a hole in the ceiling of the chamber.
[ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000358.htm">Underground Pool</A>.
You shimmy up the rope knot by knot.  Near the top, you hear a strange sound and something jerks the rope.  It sounds like it is chewing on it.  You quicken your pace and clamber over the rim of the hole.
