<H3>Shaman (#626): hostile</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRed eyes and white teeth glow at you from a dark corner.  Behind them, you can just make out a wolf's form.  Quickly, you decide not to get too close...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State7.htm">feed</A> ] cautiously drops some meat near where Shaman is lurking. He cautiously sniffs at it, then slowly approaches it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State8.htm">pet</A> ] tries to pet the wolf, then realizes her folly, as it tries to snip off her hand!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State8.htm">play</A> ] tries to play fetch with Shaman, but he just ingores the ball, keeping his eyes on visitor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State8.htm">scare</A> ] tries to scare Shaman, but just elicits a loud growl and bared fangs. Perhaps this isn't such a good idea...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State8.htm">hit</A> ] tries to hit the wolf, but he just ducks out of the way and bites visitor's leg. Man, that looks like it might need stitches!
