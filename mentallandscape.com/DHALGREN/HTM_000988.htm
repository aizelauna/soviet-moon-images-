&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing in a very dark, very short hallway.  Faint light coming through the glass door to the west reflects off of a shattered light bulb in a fixture above your head.  Bits of plaster, metal, and wood litter the floor, making it a treacherous passage in the dark.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You think you see a little light at the top of the staircase, but it is hard to tell.
[ up ] <A HREF="HTM_000417.htm">Stair Landing</A>.
You climb up the stairs, taking care not to slip on the smooth steps.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a solid wood door which has a large translucent pane of glass in the middle of it. The glass once had some words painted on it, but they have faded and are hard to read.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_002130.htm">Tattoo Den (waiting room)</A>.
After trying a few times, you are able to turn the rusted doorknob. The door creaks as you open it and step inside.
