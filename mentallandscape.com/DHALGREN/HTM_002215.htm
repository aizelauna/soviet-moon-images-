&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a dingy little alley.  It is lined with dumpsters, but most of the trash is on the ground.  The stench off the piles of rotting food containers is gut wrenching. Inside one of the dumpsters is a small wooden palette and a course blanket.  On the ground next to the dumpster is a small mirror and a large amount of make up.  Does someone live here?

The smell of garbage is making your stomach turn and head west with or without you.
