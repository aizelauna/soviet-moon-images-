&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a quieter place than the Central Fairgrounds, but still very crowded. Small shops seem to have been built overnight, but suffer no loss to their Old World charm for this; mimes and passing street magicians help to let you forget the real world.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Back through the crowd leads to the central fairgrounds, a random medley of all sorts of interesting things.

You brush through the crowds and find yourself once again back in the central airgrounds, somewhere in the circle around the strange jester.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are a few street magicians doing amusing tricks with cards, eggs, scarves, and of course, hats and bunnies. One particular magician in particular seems to be fumbling the last; he's getting Cthulhuoid monsters and cartoon characters instead.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You notice there are quite a few mimes around, clad in typical whiteface and costumes. They seem to be fingering invisible walls, pumping water and drinking tea, and otherwise amusing passerbies.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp There are a lot of shops here, but few of them seem to be open yet. You glance in the window of one knicknack shop to see a group of cutely adorable stuffed unicorns and statues of pegasi.
