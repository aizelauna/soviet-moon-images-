&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou sense a maze of dusty tunnels stretching out in front of you. The walls of the twisting corridors are filled with niches--some holding crumbling bones and tatters of clothing and others empty save for piles of mouldering dust. A cool, dry wind sighs over you and on into the tunnels behind you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA slight breeze skitters fitfully over you from somewhere further inside the catacombs. The doorway to the crypt looms in the semi-darkness.

You walk slowly and carefully back into the tunnels and away.

You step up to the doorway. The symbols around the entrance glow with viridian light. You hear a bell-like tone sound inside the room. It tolls once, twice; on the third explosion of sound the doorway fills with fire. You are pulled through and inside.
