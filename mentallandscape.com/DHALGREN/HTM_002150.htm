&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA room done all in black and silver, this place resembles some kind of sick temple erected to Corwin, Prince of Amber. The floor tiles shade from silver through grey to black. An altar sits against the north wall, beneath a beautiful oil painting of the prince himself. Several silver candles burn on the altar.
