&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing on the massive, crumbling steps leading to the door of the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Stars.  The building seems urealistically huge, and the tops of it's spires and bell-towers disappear into the dirty grey-brown-green clouds that hang over the rest of the city.  The Cathedral itself is reminiscent of the famous, ancient Gothic cathedrals of Europe; you could spend hours - or days - trying to look at every piece of sculpture that adorns it's walls, corners, and roofs.  Demonic gargoyles, cracked and chipped, disgorge a brownish sludge that drips down the stone walls, changing their colour from grey to acidic green, barely hiding the graffiti that marks nearly every wall and statue.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see the Crossroads, a quiet, eerie intersection.

You head down the steps to the street below, picking your way among the vagrants and debris.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Three solid-looking sets of oaken doors seem to be the only gates to the holy building.

You tug and pull on the doors, and after much effort, they open with a deafening screech. You struggle to hold them open as you go inside.
