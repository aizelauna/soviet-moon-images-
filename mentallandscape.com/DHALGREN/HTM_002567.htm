&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou lock eyes. His left pupil is a black silhouette of Kokapelli, and his right pupil alternates between the masks of comedy and tragedy. In the eyes of the masks you sense a smaller image, but it's too small to see. The stubble on his chin frames his smiling, thick, slightly wet lips. Thick black hair drops to his shoulders, falling on a burnt-orange t-shirt. It clings to his chest, his hard nipples casting small shadows. The outside seam of his black pants is an inch-wide gap, bridged by a zig-zagging black lace; the waist is joined by two-inch metal rings. A small metal pin adorns his left shoulder. A silver equilateral triangle points downward, above a smaller circle which is centered on the bottom tip of the triangle. The circle is a peephole into a redwood forest: you can hear the rustle of the underbrush, and feel the cool, clean air from the limbs of the gently blowing trees. His eyes roam your body with frank interest, and return to look you squarely in the eye.
