&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLooming in front of you, Stoan appears foreboding and strong. Cloaked in a translucent sheen of grey, you at times have difficulty focusing on him. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you are able to fix your gaze on him, you notice deepset onyx eyes, framed by a complexion of sheer white. His blood red lips and mahogonny hair cropped short strikingly offset the brightness of his face. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA sharp-eyed warrior goddess, spear at hand.  Her bronze armor is crawling with elaborate 
zoomorphic decoration.  Her eyes flash dangerously in your direction, and you think 
you hear the flapping of wings behind her.
