<H3> A small Crypt (#2605)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_002565.htm">donnelly</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tiny and claustrophic room that has been converted from a final resting place into a momentary living quarters. An battered mattress lies on the floor next to one graffitti covered wall. An overturned coffin serves as a couch. Candles, many burnt down to stubs, light the squat. Everywhere is littered with the guts of old computers, welded together in bizarre and organic masses. A Frankensteins laboratory of the next future. Or maybe it's just the opposite.
<BR>
<BR>
The wood is warm and rough, but suprisingly comfortable.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A battered old coffin, turned over to serve as somewhere to sit. Whether its occupant is still trapped within it... you cannot tell.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp An old black and white set. The silent static drifts and hums, although you can see no power source for the television. Occasionally, ghost images flit behind the static, as if it has picked up the traces ofa long dead station.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Someone sleeps on this? It reeks of alcohol and stale sweat.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002565.htm">donnelly</A> here.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ u ] <A HREF="HTM_002604.htm">Mausoleum</A>.
Glad to leave the crypt, you head back up.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe television momentarily tunes in to an ancient game show, then fades back to static.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is the sound of scratching from inside the coffin.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnseen cockroaches scuttle across the dark floor between broken keyboards.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe door to the Mausoleum slams upstairs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWater drips eerily from one corner of the crypt.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdonnelly appears to have made silent entry 5 seconds ago.
