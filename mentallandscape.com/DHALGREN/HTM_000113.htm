&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe road continues north and south here, intersected by a narrow road running east and west.  An old traffic light swings precariously from a frayed cable above you, flashing various colors at random.  Various items dangle from the cable: several pairs of shoes, a headless Barbie Doll, neckstump down, twisting from a noose that was once a rhinestone neckace, a Vidal Sassoon 1,000 Watt Blow Dryer, red boxer shorts and a rusting bicycle frame.  Lining the streets is a row of abandoned storefronts: roofs mostly caved in, windows shattered. The letters that remain on the dangling signs spell out meaningless words.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSome of the buildings seem to have been more or less repaired, and look inhabited.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ southeast ] <A HREF="HTM_000147.htm">Outside the D.E.W Drop Inn</A>.
You walk over to the building on the southeast corner and take your place in line. Everybody checks you out to make sure your clothes are right.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You look north along Broadway's trash-covered streets and ruined buildings.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You have to step further and further back to take in the whole of the cathedral, whose highest spires disappear in the haze over Bellona.
[ southwest ] <A HREF="HTM_001005.htm">Cathedral Steps</A>.
You climb the crumbling marble steps to the southwest, avoiding vagrants and dangerous-looking debris.
