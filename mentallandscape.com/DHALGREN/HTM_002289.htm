&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA short man. He has a balding head of stark white hair and drooping pointed ears. His eyesockets are completly empty and dark, yet he looks where anything moves, silent or not. His mouth hangs open slightly, revealing gleaming white, full healthy teeth. From the neck down it is hard to tell his age. His skin sags, yet the muscle structure is very well defined. His hands are very strong looking and his step is suprisingly light. As he turns his head this way and that he seems sometimes embrioled in conversation with himself, and his voice always seems to have more than one tone active at once.
