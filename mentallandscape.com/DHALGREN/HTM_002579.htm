&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA simple black circle.  But wait, it seems to be thicker in some places than in others.  Looking closely, you see that this thick spots don't stay in the same place; it looks almost like small bulges are moving around the perimeter of the circle independently.  Suddenly one of the thicker spots splits open and a seed rockets out, away from the skin which immediately heals.  The circle returns to an almost smooth shape.
