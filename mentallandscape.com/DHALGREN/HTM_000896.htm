&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDaylight has you hovering in the humid air...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeneath you,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp              a landscape--
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                             hills
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                                   imbued with
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                         grass-peppered terra cotta...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA peregrination rises somewhere.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A thatch of green sways with a wind, further DOWN.
[ in ] <A HREF="HTM_000816.htm">a tangle of wild flowers</A>.
You bank and glide into a smooth spiral, descending to the ground and into...
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou dance with the air on the rise of the wind...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA deft swoop... Effortlessly, you join the migrant V of a flock of birds, its velocity carrying you along in its glide.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA light bursting from the heavens above, blinds you temporarily... you bank into a slow downward spiral...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe clouds glide past, wetting you in their passage
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou float above the ground like a child's soap bubble- your concentration falters in the fear that you may *Pop!* and fall like a raindrop, hurtling towards the ground...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLike a dragon fly, you hover and swerve in utter abandon...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA wind sheer catches you in its dint... you are thrust higher....
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs an arrow, you fly with a trajectory following an arc of transcendance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAdrift, steady and floating like a feather, a gusty breeze sends you spiralling upward in the rythmic climb of a pendulum.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe moon travels past the clouds...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOh that wonderful Jupiter would twinkle at --Venus
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA wind gust carries clouds away to reveal a PRAYER-WHEEL...
