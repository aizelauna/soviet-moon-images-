&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tent of rich crimson fabric set within a walled garden. Plush silk carpets layer the floor and cover a wide mattress. Cushions of embossed leather are scattered throughout. There is a low circular table of etched brass.

This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe light gleams through the red fabric.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThere is a lush scent of roses from the garden.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou hear the snake charmer's flute and think of cobras swaying entranced.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA breeze blows in from the Bay of Tangiers, bringing a tang of salt.
