&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou stand in a huge crush of people trying to cross a nasty wooden bridge to the other side of the duck pond. There is a mermaid beneath the bridge, and a very nasty beggar whom you must pass to go west. Maybe he'll not notice you.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The sparse bermuda grass gives way to a horrid gravel parking lot to the east.

You skillfully avoid the beggar, and head east for the parking lot.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp He's a nasty one, you betcha. He leers up at you, and says, Oh, alms for a very slimy beggar, eh? Alms, please? He holds out his dinged metal cup.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's a steep climb, but you could probably make it. Besides, there's the mermaid down there. Too bad she's cheating, and wearing a shirt.

You climb down under the bridge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The fairgrounds are west of here, with waving pennants and banners, but you will not be able to get there without braving the slimy beggar.

You drop a coin into the beggar's cup, feeling rather charitable, and he allows you to pass west with many cries of A thousand thanks, noble lord!
