&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA rare issue 367! This one must be worth a mint! The story starts when Ant-head Man kidnaps SilverSkateboarder's aunt. Ant-head Man exploits SilverSkateboarder's weakness to take over the city. At the last minute, SilverSkateboarder manages to trick Ant-head Man into using his own giant deli-slicer against himself.
