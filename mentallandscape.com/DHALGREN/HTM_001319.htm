&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lighting immediately seems to dim as you enter this moderate sized park of trees known as the Feline Forest.  The leaves of the many trees mesh and blend together to form a canopy overhead, filtering out some of the light from above, and filling the forest with the warm scents of summer.  The sounds of forest creatures can be heard from places in the foliage.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs you travel along the various and many paths through the park, you see a fountain where the paths all meet.  A sculpture of a rearing feline overlooks the woods, sprayers shooting clear, cool water into the surrounding basin, with several pennies visible under the water's surface.  Several benches surround the fountain's low wall.
