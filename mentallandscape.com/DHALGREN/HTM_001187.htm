<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   ...over the radio came an announcement that a crazed killer with a
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphook in place of a hand had escaped from the local insane asylum.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe girl got scared and begged the boy to take her home.  He got mad
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand stepped on the gas and roared off.  When they got to her house,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsphe got out and went around to the other side of the car to let her
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspout.  There on the door handle was a bloody hook.
