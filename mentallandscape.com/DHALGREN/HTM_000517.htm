&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Cool marble launches twenty feet from pure white floor to vaulted ceiling. Gargoyles peek around corners, at one time watching scurrying attendants in blue starched uniforms.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     All around the room are slashed paintings hanging on the wall. The pictures were of the finest quality bordered with golden frames.  In several places on the high marble walls, "POWER TO THE PEOPLE" has been spray painted in large letters.  On the north wall, you notice rows of bullet holes.  There is an archway to the west.
