&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis used to be quite the motor. A spring night in 1952 and this car fell out of the cool aired Rockies into the long flat heat of the desert night. Turn on the radio and you might hear bird..

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOutside in the night flashes by - diners, gas stations and apple pie.  Soon dawn will well up like a surprise birthday
