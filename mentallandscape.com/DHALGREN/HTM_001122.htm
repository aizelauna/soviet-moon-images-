(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000008.htm">generic container</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000095.htm">legba</A>)

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt looks like some weird shrine constructed for the cathode gods. Standing about 6 feet high, the top half is the chunky, wooden console of an early 1960s Quasar television, its gold-plated, elongated star logo gleaming dully.  The chunky on/off knob usually to be found on the lower right has been replaced by a coin return cup.  The channel changer on the lower left has also been removed, leaving a round, black hole about three inches in diameter.  A coin slot large enough to accomodate a quarter has been bolted to the upper right hand side.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe majestic bulk of the vintage tv balances upon what appears to have once been a 21" Sony Trinitron Monitor, whose screen now seems entirely dedicated to showing nothing but incessant reruns of "Ren and Stimpy."
