&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDark oak and blood red velvet appear to be the colours of this room. The long table looks able to seat twenty easily, and is covered with a candlabra that would do any castle proud. Large doors to the east lead out to the Veranda, and another set of doors lead west to the hallway. To the north, smells of freshly baked cakes waft from the Kitchen.
