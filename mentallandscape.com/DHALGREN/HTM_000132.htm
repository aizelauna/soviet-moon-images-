&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are treading water in the river, surrounded by floating trash.  Newspapers, orange peels, used syringes.  You imagine gangsters in concrete litter the riverbed below you.  A concrete bridge pier rises out of the water just to the north, and you could probably swim over to it.  The brown water is pelted by raindrops.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ north ] <A HREF="HTM_000134.htm">Bridge Pier</A>.
You swim over and climp up onto the base of the pier.

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSomething splashes in the water near by.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou feel something nip at your ankle as you tread water.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBubbles erupt from the water near by.
