<H3> caviar (#278)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000101.htm">Generic Edible Object</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000150.htm">Calkins</A>)

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a porcelain plate with a small ceramic container of beluga caviar imported from the Caspian Sea.  Next to it is a small silver spoon.  The salted sturgeon roe glistens like wet obsidian sand.
<BR>
It smells musky and slightly fruity.
<BR>
An intriguing hint of flavor, but you really need to eat it to get the full effect.
<BR>
Didn't your mother tell you not to play with your food?
<BR>
You eat a spoonful of the caviar.  As you chew, tiny beads of liquid flavor burst open like microscopic grapes in your mouth, flooding it with a salty, slightly fishy aroma.
