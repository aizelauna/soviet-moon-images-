&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou have entered the Parlour of the Chantry. In this room, people meet, socialize and relax. There are several couches, all of the large, victorian back, and a couple of chairs. The colours of the room are dark oak, red velvet and cream, and the carpeting is thick. In the south of the room stands a large fireplace and hearth, which always has a cheery blaze burning.
