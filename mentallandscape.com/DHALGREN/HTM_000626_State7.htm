<H3>Shaman (#626): wary</H3>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large grey half-wolf, lurking on the edge of things.  His dirty grey fur looks patchy, and his black ear-tips are cocked back warily.  He seems to be looking into your eyes, trying to figure you out.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626.htm">feed</A> ] tries to feed the half-wolf, who backs up a few steps. Perhaps with a bit more coaxing...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626.htm">pet</A> ] tries to pet the half-wolf, who backs up a few steps. Perhaps with a bit more coaxing...

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State7.htm">play</A> ] tries to play fetch with the half-wolf. He doesn't seem very cooperative: perhaps you need to win his trust first.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State8.htm">hit</A> ] tries to hit the half-wolf, who leaps out of thee way, almost taking a bite out of her arm!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp[ <A HREF="HTM_000626_State7.htm">scare</A> ] scares Shaman, whho bares his fangs and growls back. Looking at those teeth, you have second thoughts about a show of dominance.
