&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see now that the object visible from the beach was the top of a large oak tree emerging from the waters!  Looking down you see the outlines of buildings and streets beneath the waves.  With a chill, you realize you are floating above the watery grave of Islandia, one of the first great MUDs.  Your gaze is drawn downward.  You also notice something further out to the east.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see the shore of Bellona to the west.

You row back to the beach and drag the boat back up on shore.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Looking down, you see ghostly movement in the sunken world. You are tempted to dive down to it.

You dive into the water and swim downward. A ghostly spell seems to overcome you as you enter the lost world of Islandia. Suddenly you seem to be taken back to the days before the great MUD sank beneath the waves.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see something in the distance that may be another submerged tree.

You row your boat east, heading out to sea further.
