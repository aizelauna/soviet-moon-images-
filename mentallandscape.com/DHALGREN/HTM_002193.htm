<H3> Removal Chamber (#2193)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000955.htm">Generic Room with Seats</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_000538.htm">Eclipse</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis room is white and bright and sterile-looking, with a hospital-room feel to it.  Flourescent lights in tracks along the ceiling shine relentlessly, emphasizing the whiteness of the walls and tile floor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe room is almost frighteningly devoid of objects.  A stainless steel sink sticks out obtrusively from one wall, gleamingly clean, soap and gloves resting on the shelf above it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe only other objects to be seen are a black leather chair, sitting directly under a flourescent lamp, dominating the room; a magnifying glass on a swivel arm, attached to the arm of the chair; and a low wooden stool next to the chair, seemingly meant for an observer or somesuch.
<BR>
<BR>
You nervously ease into the black leather chair.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_002014.htm">Dr. Sass</A> and <A HREF="HTM_002149.htm">sign</A> here.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A large, heavy-looking steel door leading north, the only exit from this room.

You sigh in relief as you exit the room, glad the procedure is over with.
