&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe hole to the other side of the tracks is large enough to fit several people in, all lying down. The bottom and sides of this hole are covered in a blackish thick liquid, and the smell belies a sewer. There is the sound of slowly moving water on the other side of the hole, but there is little to no light.
