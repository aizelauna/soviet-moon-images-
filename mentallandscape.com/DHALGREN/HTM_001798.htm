&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a cliff hanging far over the white-capped seas. A single tree spreads its branches wide over the grassy clearing, and farther to the west, you can see the topiary.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A translucent white disc set in the center of the street.
[ ss ] <A HREF="HTM_001795.htm">Intersection of King and Queen Streets</A>.
You step onto the disc and rematerialize far to the south...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This path leads westwards to the Unicorn Point Topiary. This is a garden with many large rose bushes cut into intricate shapes.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001803.htm">Unicorn Point Topiary</A>.
You walk westwards into a wonderfully rose-scented garden. All around you, flowering bushes rear up, cut and pruned into mythological shapes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A translucent white disc is in the center of the street.
[ nn ] <A HREF="HTM_001814.htm">Mountain Peak</A>.
You step onto the disc and rematerialize far to the north...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A small path wends around the rising cliff to some point directly beneath the rocky protuberance. It looks like a very narrow ledge.
[ down ] <A HREF="HTM_001902.htm">Under Unicorn Point</A>.
You carefully walk down around the cliff and find yourself standing in a wider part of the ledge to your relief.
