&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTo the north, across flat rock (puddles of rain water fill the depressions), is a building of black stones, rounded and the size of heads, webbed with white mortar.  Above the building's several wings rises a square tower with a crenellated balcony of the same black stone.  The vaulted windows, paned with pebbled glass, are deeply recessed.  You hear waves crashing from the east.

You look intently to the south, trying to capture the glittering lights in your gaze. You find yourself taking one step, then another...
