&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe silence is overpowering. But not as overpowering as the complete lack of light. You can't see anything, and rely on your sweaty fingers on the cold wall for guidance. You are sure that something is in here with you. You can almost feel its breath upon your back. Something brushing up against your legs.
