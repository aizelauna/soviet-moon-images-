&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA dark figure looming in front of you... He is wearing a
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspblack cloak with the hood drawn loosely around his head...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom the shadows of the hood you see a pair of dark eyes
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsppeering upon you, sending an eerie chill down your spine 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand raising bumps on your skin... A cold dark mist seems to
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfollow him everywhere he roams... He speaks softly, gently...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn aura of warmth eminates from an unknown place in his 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbeing, contrasting with the cold, uncaring exterior...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou know that there is a great deal of kindness in this 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspperson, however...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen crossed he will strike in blinding silence, cutting
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou to the bone, without hesitation...
