&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see Typhon, the spirit of catastrophes, who rises out of a flaming abyss and brandishes a torch above the heads of two men chained at his feet.  It is the image of Fatality which bursts into certain lives like the eruption of a volcano, and overwhelmes great as well as small, strong and weak, the cleverest and the least perceptive, in its equal disaster.
