&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...a long smile...
<BR>

<BR>
<BR>
After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSmile into your eyes. Close them a second and relax and smile into them.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBy relaxing your eyes, the signals for reactive or reflective energy, you can calm your entire nervous system.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe smile falls like a waterfall down into your body.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSmile down your face, into your jaws. Tension evaporates. You may feel sensations.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour tongue is on the roof of your mouth behind your front teeth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDown through the neck the smile relaxes you further.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou might tighten and relax your neck, tuck in your chin and suspend your head, smile into your neck and throat.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe smile melts into your heart, the seat of love and compassion.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlood courses through it, irradiated by your smile.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour heart feels warm, steady, calm, heavy.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs the coming and going of blood is energized, your whole body awakens to your smile.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom there the energy of the smile flows into the lungs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe air in your chest lightens as it leaves, the lungs moist and springy.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThen the smile drops into the abdomen.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspInto your liver, on the right below your ribs. It softens with the smile.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the lower back, on either side, below the ribs, your kidneys receive the smile.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe adrenal glands, above the kidneys, smile.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThroughout your central abdomen, your smile flows through the pancreas and spleen.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe smile descends and rests in your navel.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt circulates around your tantien and recirculates for a while.
