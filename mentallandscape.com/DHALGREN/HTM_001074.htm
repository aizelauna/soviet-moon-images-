&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp245 millian years in the past: it is night and you gasp in the oxygen-depleted atmosphere.  In the distance you see a volcanic eruption that fills the sky with an orange glow.  Adding to the light is the burning of a forest of giant horsetails.  The stench of decay and sulphur is overpowering, and you notice the nearby beach is heaped with dead trilobites -- 90 percent of all living species will become extinct in this mysterious catastrophie.
