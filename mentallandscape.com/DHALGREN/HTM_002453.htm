&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mussed and marred page ripped out of a pocket-sized booklet. Across the top is scrawled 'METATRON, 1985.' On one side, desperate black scribbles obscure the text. The other remains legible.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and even in time, fall in love with far-distant
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     strangers,  perhaps  even  mate  with  the gods
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     . . . as  the  ancients  were  reputed  to have
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     done.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp       People seated at their terminals forget time,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     sitting   mesmerized,   their   fingers   jerk-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     ing spastically at the keys,  their eyes blear-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     ing.  In time, so the sales pitch goes, comput-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     ers will achieve  artificial intelligence  (and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     perhaps  even  use   "biochips"  and  so  live)
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     and  what's  more,  they will be more rational,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     organize   knowledge  more  neatly   than   our
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     poor  brain   can,  once  certain  problems  of
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     miniaturization,  heat,  switching speeds,  and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     the  development   of  sophisticated,   "human-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     like,"  or  artificial  intelligence  languages
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     have  been solved.  Perhaps then  they will  be
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     able  to attain  that kind of "randomness"  and
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     "intuitive" leap  humans make  so easily  with-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     out having  to scan and compare  lists.  Having
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     been talked  into surrendering our spirit,  our
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     knowledge,  our  bodies  will  become  useless.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     We will,  like Jesus,  like Faust,  like Dante,
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     achieve  immortality  and " evolve"  into  com-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     puter   compatible   and   re-programmed   his-
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     tory,   one   with   Bablon,   Nineveh,   Rome.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp     Our essences  will be  preserved  in that great
