&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a commercial street with a shopping center to the east (a parking lot, really, surrounded with lots of stores). The hotel is to the west, and King Street enters an intersection to the north or continues to the south.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp South leads to more of King Street.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001736.htm">King Street</A>.
You walk south along King Street, looking up at the office buildings and almost bumping into the pedestrians walking around.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp West goes through sliding glass doors into the hotel. It looks quite crowded with fans, but there looks like a lot of interesting things going on in there.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_001688.htm">Registration</A>.
You push your way through the sliding doors and over some fans who have fainted from overexcitement.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The parking lot looks rather crowded with cars.
[ east ] <A HREF="HTM_001792.htm">King Street Shopping Center</A>.
You avoid the cars passing by and find yourself in a wide parking lot.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can see the intersection of Queen and King Street not too far away.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001795.htm">Intersection of King and Queen Streets</A>.
You walk north along King Street to the intersection.
