&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou find yourself in a small room.  Nothing is especially interesting until you see the books.  There are thousands of books in this tiny room.  Stacks and stacks of books line the walls in a haphazard array.  Some are in scavenged crates, others on makeshift shelves of boards and cinder blocks.  The books are in various conditions, most tattered and ill-used, some few in good condition.  Most of the paperbacks are dog-eared from much handling; many of the hardbacks have lost their dustcovers.  It looks as if someone has raided old libraries and bookstores to amass a collection of this size.  Perhaps someone did.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mattress with a few blankets takes up much of the floor-space.

You lie on the mattress.
