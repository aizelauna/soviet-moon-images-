&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis small foyer looks like it was once the hub of the house.  To the north are the double doors forming the main entrance to the house.  There is a smashed mirror at about head height on the east wall, just to the right of a corridor leading off to the east.  The south wall is all rough stonework, the back of the living room fireplace; at the west end of the wall is the opening leading south into the living room and southwest is a boarded up doorway. Finally, to the west is an open archway leading into a burned out area.
