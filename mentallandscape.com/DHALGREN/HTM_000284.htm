&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a mall porcelain bowl of thick brown soup with cubes of the highly prized, greenish top-shell meat of a turtle.  On the dish beside the bowl are reserved the thinly sliced liver and a small mound of turtle eggs.
<BR>
You smell a meaty broth, spiced with thyme and cloves and onions.
<BR>
The brown broth is oniony and spiced with thyme, cloves, allspice and bay.  It is full of diced turtle meat, savory and gelatinous, with a texture almost like hard-boiled egg at first bite.
