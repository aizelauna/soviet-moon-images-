&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKane bares a striking resemblance to a young Orson Welles.  He was, in fact, cloned from Welles' DNA in order to star in the hit Broadway version of 'Citizen Kane'.  His transition to a harsher world has not been as easy one, as a long scar across his left cheek attests.  His genetic engineering has given him only one tool for survival: acting.   He lives in this world by playing whatever part will lead to the next meal, by sensing the needs of others and molding himself to whatever character will best exploit any given situation.  His very being is a kind of lie, so it should come as no surprise that he lives by deception.
