&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are in a narrow alley way between two brick buildings. The ground is littered with trash, old newspapers, empty cans, bricks set up as a fireplace with an arrangement of pipes over it. Beside it is an army messpan, inside filled with dirty rain water. At the east end of the alley is a fence.
