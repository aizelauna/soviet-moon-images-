&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis place seems to have been, at one time, a store or trading post. A counter lies along the floor on the southern half of the room, and empty shelves line the walls. Various forms of debris line the floor, and a large scaffold sits by the west wall. A narrow doorway leads steeply north, back to the temple proper. A few torches mounted high on the walls keep the room alight.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ shelf ] <A HREF="HTM_001765.htm">Dark Tunnel</A>.
You move the shelf; a secret passage opens up in the wall and, confidently, you step through.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This thin stairway to the north climbs rather steeply.
[ out ] <A HREF="HTM_001771.htm">Sacrificial Pit</A>.
You climb back up the stairway, returning to the temple.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This scaffolding, used by the workers to reach the ceiling and high walls, appears deserted now, though sturdy.
[ scaffold ] <A HREF="HTM_001783.htm">Atop the Scaffold</A>.
You easily climb the scaffolding toward the dark ceiling above.
