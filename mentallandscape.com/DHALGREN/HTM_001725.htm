&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a long stretch of white beach, curving far to the north where the east side of the island appears to be. The ocean laps gently here, but far off you can see massive breakers foaming against coral reefs.

You disappear through a line of palm trees and find yourself at the edge of the town.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp From here, the coral reefs just look like grey rocks upon which large white breakers are dashed.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The beach continues far to the northeast, eventually culminating in the midst of jungles.

You walk northeast, admiring the endless horizon of blue oceans and the pretty sparkles of the white sand.
