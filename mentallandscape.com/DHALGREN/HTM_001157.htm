&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnother lamp glows dimly in the hallway here. Its flame is only a little brighter than the other. The shadows are steady here, but the silence still pervades this place like a watchful creature. The stone walls are even colder than they have been, and the thick carpeting still covers the floor.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A heavy wooden door set in the stone wall.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Further down the hallway you can see another lamp, though much dimmer.

You shuffle down the hall and notice things getting dimmer.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A short distance ahead, you can see that the hallway ends. There is some stuff down there, you think.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001174.htm">Base of Ladder</A>.
You walk a short distance north.
