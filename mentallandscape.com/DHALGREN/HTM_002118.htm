&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere is the One, the Savior, the giver of life and the sufferer of our pains.  He glows in holy presence and he knows you with a glance.  He's dressed in falling-apart hippy clothing, and his tattoos incorporate his stigmata deftly into them.  He looks to you, saying, Come, child. Come into my reality.
