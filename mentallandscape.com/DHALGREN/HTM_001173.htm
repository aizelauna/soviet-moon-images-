&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are surrounded by gardenias.  Their leaves are waxy and dark green -- the plants covered with buds, blossoms, and dying blooms.  Petals litter the surface of the tattered blue sleeping bag which covers the roof underneath.  The fragrance of the flowers hangs heavy in the air -- touching your skin, overpowering your senses.  This is a place of quiet and sharing -- safe, private, lucious in its beauty.  It is a place formed and tended by loving hands.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDays gone by I've sat here, looking for an answer in your eyes.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRaining down all over us, water pouring all around.

This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA breeze stirs the petals all around us, filling the air with warm snow.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBelow us, cats sing in the alley.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA mouse peers out from behind one of the plants.
