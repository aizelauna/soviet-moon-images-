&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe sand ends as the pine trees become denser and lusher. Pine needles and sand are in your shoes and the breeze is deliciious with the scent of both. The light filters down through the trees and small pools of water have collected around the  hollows between the roots. A bluff rises to the west, the trees thinning out over its rise.  There's a crack that's big enough to permit someone to enter the bluff, a neat cave to explore!  A dead pine tree, worn down where  some large animal has been using it as a backscratcher makes you think twice about following that impulse.
