<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA fairly large, jet-black spider whose attractive blue markings serve as camouflage in its natural habitat.
<BR>
That's a bit silly, isn't it?
<BR>
You lick the spider...sugar, dust, and something else...
<BR>
The spider wriggles around in your hand, legs tickling the inside of your palm.
<BR>
Seized by a mysterious urge to emulate Dracula's madman, you pop the spider in your mouth.  Your tongue immediately begins tingling mysteriously...
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You see Jim Rose dancing on the head of a pin.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You see Fakir Musafar french-kissing Marilyn Quayle.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The Dying Moon Carnival of days gone by whirls in front of your eyes, flashing brilliant colors and glittering lights.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You suddenly understand Judith Butler.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You see Dream Date Barbie, life-size and insane, running at you with a chainsaw.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You see the Devil in a golden tuxedo.  You dance a jig with her.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Like the edges of a dream during the waking state, tattooing showed the sailor that dreams are made actual through pain.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...You crush grapes in clusters with your toes.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Moreover, since the I who desired and the eye who perceived had nothing to do with each other and at the same time existed in the same body - mine:  I was not possible.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...Girls will be boys and boys will be girls...it's a mixed up muddled up shook up world.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...I'm not dumb but I can't understand why she walks like a woman and talks like a man.
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp...The sea is black with robots' blood.
