&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is the town police station, reserved for criminals and annoying people who offend the wizards. Government Street is outside to the north, and a dark and lonely prison cell to the south.

<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see Government Street outside the police station.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001707.htm">Government Street East</A>.
You exit the police station.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ south ] <A HREF="HTM_001716.htm">Prison Cell</A>.
As you enter the prison cell, the door clangs shut behind you.
