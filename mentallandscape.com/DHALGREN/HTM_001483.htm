<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCorded muscles cast in black iron; goathorned, barbtailed and dragonwinged, with 
the leering face of a satyr.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA preindustrial concept with postindustrial modular prostheses, a lawn jockey gone 
Maroon and satanic with a techno-hoodoo whammy for massa.  
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt looks entirely inanimate, as such a thing should rightly be.
