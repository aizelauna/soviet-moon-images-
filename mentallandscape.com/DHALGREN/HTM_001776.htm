&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis rather protruding, flat ledge performs the rather passive active role of getting in the way, keeping things that are meant to be sacrificed from reaching their fate. It was probably conjured up by some bored god who felt like punishing the weak who can't throw very far. Indeed, many objects have landed here.

You see <A HREF="HTM_001779.htm">Super Chicken</A> here.
