&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis generic room has messages that you can set that will be displayed randomly after a certain delay. They will play as long as a player is in that room. See `help #176'.

Go to location of this object, <A HREF="HTM_000179.htm">Cluttered Closet</A>.

HELP MANUAL:
<BR>
<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSettable properties:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.amb_delay - this is the delay between random announcements, in seconds.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp             The default is 5 minutes, or 300 seconds.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.amb_noise - this is the list of random messages you wish to display.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp.active    - set to 1 (default) when runs. Set to 0 to turn off ambient noise
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp             behavior entirely.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll you need to do is @notedit the .amb_noise property and enter in all possible 
messages you want announced. The order doesn't matter.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThen, whenever a player enters, the announcements will start and appear every .amb_delay 
seconds. If the .amb_noise property is empty, nothing will happen and the room will 
act like a normal blank room would.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNote - the first noise message appears 30 seconds after the first player enters.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp----
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCommands:
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp@restart
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe owner of the room can call this verb to restart the ambient noise tasks. Mostly 
in the case when .active was set to 0 for a while, then set back to 1 while there 
are people still in the room.
