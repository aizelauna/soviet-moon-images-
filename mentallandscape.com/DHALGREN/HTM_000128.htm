&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt was a corner store once, the kind that kids walked to to buy pez and Baby Ruth and red licorice and where old men bought newspapers and cigars on Sunday mornings.  You can just make out the letters "M, R, een, St and r" on the faded white sign whose paint has all but crumbled off.

EXITS:

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a large, plate-glass window, notable primarily because it is one of the few unbroken windows on the block.

You scramble through the windowframe, being careful not to cut yourself too badly.

You bend down and attempt to lift the heavy security door. After some struggle, you manage to shove it up high enough to allow you to enter the store. You duck under it and step inside just in time to avoid its crashing down again on your head. It hits the sidewalk with a resounding thud.

You head southeast, back to the street.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's big. It's a pothole. It's so big that someone could live in there for chrissakes. It's big enough to fall into!

You step close to the edge and start f..a..l..l..i..n..g into the deep, dark hole...
