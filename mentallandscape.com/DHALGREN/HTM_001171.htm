After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  There is a story tells
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  of a power of the air, bright
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  power of stars and starlight,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    stepping down to stride the hills
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      and strew them
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                  with    st    a        r
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                            s  e    e        d       s
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp          scattering star-corn across the soil to grow,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      giving earth her need,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  granting earth to bear bounty below.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Oh imagining ourselves children
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    of one like this,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Earth,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    on your length we lie.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    Born from your desires
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    that we might touch the stars
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp    imagining we are of their stuff.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Our stuff and substance might be from starry skies.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  In that you are stars.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Earth, we were born of your cascading
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  the seeds we find in fruits of your dreaming.
