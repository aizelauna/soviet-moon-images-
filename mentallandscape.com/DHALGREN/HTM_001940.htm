&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspHere, the crawlway turns from south to west; looking around from this small ledge, you can see the Sacrifical Pit area spread out below you. Thin amounts of smoke rise up to this hight, and the sounds of the world below intermix to create a general sense of constant thriving.

You crawl back along to the south.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You can see the smoke and flame rising up from the pit. You also notice what seems to be a large outcropping-- or a ledge-- partway down the pit.
