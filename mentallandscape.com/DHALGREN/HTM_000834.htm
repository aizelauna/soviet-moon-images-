&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp                    GENERIC LITTER
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Generic Litter is very simple:  it's a note, which blows
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  from place to place.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Make your own by typing @create #834 named <anything>.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Use @notedit for an easy way to write on your litter.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Use @setinterval to set the time litter will take to blow
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  from one place to the next (in seconds). The minimum
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  interval allowed is 180 seconds.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The only other thing you need to know is how to ban the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  litter from a certain place. (The wind blows oddly in
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Bellona.)  Type ban <name> from <place> to do it. Use the
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  object number of the place.  @rmban <place> from <name> will
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  allow the litter back in.  (You can also ban other people's 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  litter from your own spaces.)  This function may also be 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  used to delimit a territory within which the litter may 
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  blow, if you like.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  @messages to set on Generic Litter are @blow_in and @blow_out.
