&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a man hung by one foot from a gallows which rests on two trees each of which has six branches cut from the trunk.  The hands of this man are tied behind his back, and the bend of his arms forms the base of an inverted triangle the summit of which ishis head.  It is the isng of violent death encountered by tragic accident or in the expiation ofsome crime, and accepted in a spirit of heroic devotion to Truth and Justice.  The twelve lopped branches signify the extinction of life, the destruction of the twelve houses of the Horoscope.  The inverted triangle symbolises catastrophe.
