<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining and secure this day in Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYour feet stir up the dust as you enter this place and you instinctively clap your hand over your mouth and nose while looking around.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspClearly, nobody has had lunch here in a very long time. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA fallen sign proclaims, 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlue Plate Special..... $22.38
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRice Pudding.... $7.95
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAll prices include federal, city, and block taxes.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGratuities always welcome.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOther footprints in the dust lead you to believe that you aren't the only one who wishes this place were still open for business with prices as reasonable as those.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt seems as if someone might even be rehabilitating this old luncheonette.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn one corner is an upright formica-topped table and some chairs.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs you rub your eyes you see a jukebox glowing from a dark corner.
<BR>
<BR>
EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp As you look out of this multi-colored, patched plexiglass storefront you can see the words: ettenoehcnuL kraP. Through the window you can see the street outside and beyond, the Park.
