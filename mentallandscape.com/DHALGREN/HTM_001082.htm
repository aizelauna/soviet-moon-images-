&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe ceiling rises high above you in this grand hall. The remnants of a plush carpet are pushed to the sides while your footsteps echo eerily on the black bare marble. The stone walls are bare, but also show signs of not always being like that. High above you a brass chandelier holds a few flickering candles, shedding some light.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp At the southern end of the hall there is set a stone archway. Peaked at the top like the kind you might find a gothic cathedral.
[ south ] <A HREF="HTM_000580.htm">Dark Foyer</A>.
Your footsteps echo as you leave the hall and step through the archway at the end.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A heavy, thick looking door. Made of old oak and bound in heavy iron.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The hallway continues for quite a ways.

You continue up the hall, your footsteps echoing until you are suddenly walking on carpeting.
