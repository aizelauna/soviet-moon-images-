&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are in the branches of one of the largest willow trees you have ever seen.  Dizzily far beneath you is the ground, but somehow the height isn't scary.  The large boughs are strong as they spread out from the trunk and span the distance to others.  Around the trunk, where four of the largest branches arch from, a redwood platform has been built.  It is sturdy under you, like a big tree house without the roof or walls.  On it are a few redwood benches to sit on and listen to the birds.
