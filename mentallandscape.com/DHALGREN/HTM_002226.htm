After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspit is thy mouth that i desire, jokanaan.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthy mouth is like a band of scarlet on a tower of ivory.  it is like a pomegranate cut in twain with a knife of ivory.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&
<BR>

<BR>
