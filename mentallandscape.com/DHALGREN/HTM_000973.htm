&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe eastern gate was forged to match the gate opposite.  By a mistress, seemingly...the piece looks like it belongs in a gallery.  Iron snakes and bugs trace along it, almost looking alive.  On the other side you can see a little street.  You're going to have to figure out another way to see what's hanging here...
