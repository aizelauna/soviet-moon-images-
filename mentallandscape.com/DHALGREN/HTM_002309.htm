&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis is a big, dark, echoing room. Across the dimly lit expanse of broken parquet tiles, you can see a circle of light. Squinting, you realize that it is the grand, fallen chandelier. Most of the candle-flame-shaped bulbs have shattered. Stuck in their broken bases are real candles, white and glowing.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the center of the ring there's a bedroll and a hunk of cheese.
