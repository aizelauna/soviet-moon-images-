After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspTHOU fair-hair'd angel of the evening,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNow, whilst the sun rests on the mountains, light
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThy bright torch of love; thy radiant crown
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPut on, and smile upon our evening bed!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSmile on our loves, and, while thou drawest the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlue curtains of the sky, scatter thy silver dew
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn every flower that shuts its sweet eyes
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn timely sleep.  Let thy west wind sleep on
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe lake; speak silence with thy glimmering eyes,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd wash the dusk with silver.  Soon, full soon,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDost thou withdraw; then the wolf rages wide,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAnd the lion glares thro' the dun forest:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe fleeces of our flocks are cover'd with
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThy sacred dew: protect them with thine influence.
<BR>
