&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou have discovered a paleolithic ritual space.  Dramatic images of plant and animal spirits cover the domed ceiling of the chamber, painted in shades of ocher and charcoal.  A river with a path beside it flows from the west and plunges out of sight into the earth.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThese signs explain some local objects and features of interest.  You will find out how to reach the next chamber in sign2, but if you don't have time, you can just type "next".

You begin chanting until you become delirious and overwhelmed with a sense of paleolithic zeitgeist.  As you lose consciousness, you see human figures with animal heads lift you up and carry you away.  You wake up in a tourist information center for "Red Caves State Park".  Tourists and park guides look at you, wondering if you're on drugs.
