&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining this day in Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAn old barrel turned into a hot tub. Woodfired.. the water is just right, the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp size is perfect. Carved wooden benches line the sides. Two brass buttons
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp (left and right) are within reach.  The setting sun shines golden on your
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp face.  Light shines up through the water, casting dancing shadows all around.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  Rising bubbles soothe.
