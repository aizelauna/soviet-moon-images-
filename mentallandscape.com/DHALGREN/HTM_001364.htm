<H3> Johnathon's basement (#1364)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_000110.htm">Generic Post-Apocalypse Room</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001358.htm">Johnathon</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis room is a slightly damp and gloomy basement. It is lit by a single
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplow-wattage bulb hanging on a frayed cord. The bulb flickers occasionally
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplike a candle about to go out. A trestle table against the wall has 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa number of pieces of junk sitting on it. Raw concrete shows though
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe miscellanous scraps of carpet glued haphazardly to the floor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspVarious posters on the walls show rock/goth bands. Your eyes are 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspdrawn to the huge coffee machine on top of a chest of drawers in the
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspcorner of the room.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA flight of stairs leads up, and there is a ceiling grate.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A slightly rickety trestle table supporting several pieces of hardware and typical electronic workshop tools
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Posters of "The Sisters of Mercy", "The Mission", "Dream Theater", "Rush" and others.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A standard basement grate leading to the pavement above.
