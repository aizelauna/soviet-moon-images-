&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA rather large, excited crowd mills about this room; a stage is set at its northern end, with a red curtain behind. A rather interesting-looking man stands on the stage behind a podium, speaking rapidly. Behind him, where it would be hidden if the curtain were to close, sits a glass case full of the things he is auctioning. To leave, you could push your way back through the doorway to the south.

You manage to force your way through the milling crowd.
