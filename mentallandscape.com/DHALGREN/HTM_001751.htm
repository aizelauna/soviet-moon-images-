&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe curtains are thick, soft, and of a reddish-brown color; eerily, they seem to sway slightly in the darkness. They hang from the walls, near the ceiling, from just below the statues feet, almost as if the statues keep the curtains hanging by sheer weight. They hang down low, below the raised level of the path, almost touching the floor.
