<pre>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you're here for a tattoo removal, sit in the black chair and shut up.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIf you're here to watch a tattoo removal, sit on the stool and shut up.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhen you are ready to have your tattoo removed, simply `ask Dr. Sass to remove tattoo'. 
 And prepare to squirm.
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEnjoy.
