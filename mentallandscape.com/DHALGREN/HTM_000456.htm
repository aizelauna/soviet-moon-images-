&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis seems to have once been the room where the priests prepared for mass.  A battered wardrobe rests against one wall, and the remains of a fine white china dish lay shattered in a stainless steel sink.  An open cupboard reveals an empty box labeled, "Holy Wafers".  A faded and much-abused picture of the Mother barely hangs on one wall.

You see <A HREF="HTM_000576.htm">Big Box O' Numbers</A> here.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a dark room, which appears to have several starcases leading in different directions.
[ west ] <A HREF="HTM_000417.htm">Stair Landing</A>.
You head for the dimly lit room to the west.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The chamber beyond this room appears to be dimly lit and silent, but you get the feeling that it is a much larger area than the one you are in.
[ north ] <A HREF="HTM_001002.htm">Cathedral Altar</A>.
You head north, towards the altar and cathedral proper.
