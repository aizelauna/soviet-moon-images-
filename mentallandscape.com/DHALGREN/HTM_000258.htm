&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tall man with light brown hair and strangely green eyes. He is wearing what seems to be castoff military clothing, including a leather flight jacket with the name Jake Crusher stitched over the left chest pocket. His boots seem to have been freshly cleaned and he carries a PowerBook.
