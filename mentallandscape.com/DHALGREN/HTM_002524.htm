&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFool! You were warned but you just couldn't listen could you? Sheesh. Now you're in for it. As you gaze at what should be your own familar face, beloved only by your mother, the image shifts. After a dizzying moment -- what else can you expect, afterall you're inside a toadstool and some toadstool is inside you -- a vision gains uncertain focus. Greens and blues swirl and slide into parkland and sky.
