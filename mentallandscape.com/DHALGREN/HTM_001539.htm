&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is raining this day in Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust a small room.  It smells like sweetgrass and juniper and the sea. The
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsplight dances across the wide pine floorboards and makes the curved, adobe
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwalls fairly glow.  A low platform at one end serves as a bed. A small open
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspfirepit at the other heats whatever you might want.
