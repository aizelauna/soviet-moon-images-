&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe unicorn is a bush shaped like an equine rampant, hooves reaching in the air to 
defend the unicorn from some unseen predator. Bright orange and yellow flowers adorn 
its flaring mane of long leaves, and its horn is tipped with a pure white rose of 
extraordinary beauty.
