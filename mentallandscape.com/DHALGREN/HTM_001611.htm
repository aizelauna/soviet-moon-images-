&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are inside an old and very used GIGANTIC sneaker. This at least have to be size 800.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is still warm. And the strong smell of sweathy foot fills the air.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn the 'floor' is a deep black clear outline of a bare foot. Clearly it have been used alot.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAs your nostrils get used to the strong smell you can also detect an underlying smell as if someone uses the deep foot imprint as a toilet. Also the floor feels spongy and somewhat wet.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspup through the top you can see the Hatch to the Bar.
