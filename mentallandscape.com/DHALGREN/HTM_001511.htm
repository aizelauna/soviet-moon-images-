&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a guy dressed in what looks like the remnants of a business suit,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspif that's what you can call it, since its been shredded into almost rags.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnderneath it you can see part of a leather outfit, consisting mainly of
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspa leather jock and a chest harness.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn his back, there is his versatitle green bag, containing all of his
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptreasured possessions, including some fun, and unusual, 'toys'.
