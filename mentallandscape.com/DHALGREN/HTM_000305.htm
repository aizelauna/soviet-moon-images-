&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou stand in the middle of a cracked and heaving apron of oil-stained cement. Weeds jut up through the fissures; sawgrass and scrub juniper encroach on all sides. At the northernmost margin of the lot is a large metal quonset hut flanked by two droning gasoline generators. A crumbling stretch of service road lies to the east.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspRain beats sullenly on the concrete and resonates on the pressed steel roof of the quonset.  Dim, diffracted light washes down from a low gray sky.

The hangar door is difficult to budge. Finally, with a groaning and squealing of unlubricated metal, it opens wide enough for you to step through.
