&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA slender youth about 6'0 dressed stylishly in black. He seems to flow more than move. He is lithe and agile which makes up for his more than obvious lack of testosterone induced strength. He smiles wanly as though the world were a personal joke for his amusement. But that is just to hide the fact that his mind is on something completely different from whatever he is looking at. His mind wanders...in fact it hasn't returned from its excursion and now he has to look for it. Silly things may fall out of Alden's mouth. Please forgive him. *grin*
