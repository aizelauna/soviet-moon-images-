&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA truck is overturned at the block's end, and three cars, windows rimmed with smashed glass, squat on skewed hubs.  To the east, there are no buildings: trees rise above the wall of the park.  Stone lions, stoically enduring the rain, flank the entrance.  To the west, you see a cafe.  A trash bin sits on the corner.

You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Two stone lions stare back with deeply chiseled dark eyes.
