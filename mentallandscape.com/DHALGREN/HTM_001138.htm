<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   The mask is finely carved, of wood
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   smooth and painted white. It shows
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   the face of a fair princess, young
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   but worn, with sorrow in her eyes.

After a moment, something begins to happen...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe mask is a beautiful princess
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp           missing a lost lover.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIn her hands is whatever passion
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp           her face cannot show.
