&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are inside the bottle of genie. The lighting is muted through sapphires and emeralds, and has the vague sense of the sea. There are pillows and cushions here, that can be piled into beds, chairs, or just sprawled upon in any old fashion. It seems that it should not be quite so large in here, but it is. Something clicks in your mind about itty bitty living spaces and the phenomenal cosmic power that accompanies it...hmmm....
