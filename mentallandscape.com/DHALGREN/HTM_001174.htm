&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe hallway ends at this point. The only light here is the feeble remnants of the last flickering lamp to the south. The shadows are large and dark here, but you can still make out some detail.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A very small wooden door. You'll probably have to duck to get through it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You think you see an old and cracked trap door at the top of the ladder, but you aren't sure. Definitely, the chill draft is coming from there.

You start up the ladder, feeling the iron chill you to the bone immediately. The layers of dust make it slippery, but you reach the top. Pushing on the trap door, it opens with a loud creak. You climb into the room.
