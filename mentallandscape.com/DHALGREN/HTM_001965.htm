&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLight filters tentatively through the dark rose opacity surrounding you,
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspmaking all here appear blushed.  The shadows move in ripples through this
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspwomblike chamber.  With each breath you inhale the heady, not-quite-cloying
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspscent of rich earth and blossoms.

<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspsynchronizes to the rhythms of shared illusion.
