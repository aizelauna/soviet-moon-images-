&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a dark, forbidding room. It is dimly lit by a cathedral-sized window in the east wall. The walls are rough stone, stretching high above you to the vaulted ceiling. Dusty oaken bookshelves cover the walls, packed with ancient, mystical tomes. The floor is made up of black marble blocks, closely set together. Your footsteps echo as you enter the room. A crystal chandelier hangs from a chain in the center of the room. Along the south wall is a mantled fireplace. A fire within adds some warmth to the room. Antique furniture decorates the den, the largest being a dark desk. Chairs, a sofa, and small tables complete the ensemble.

The test dispenser shakes a bit as a brand new cotton candy slips out into your hands.

You are holding nothing.<BR>

You look closely at the bookcase and notice a book that's not quite right. Pulling it, the wall rotates and you step through.
