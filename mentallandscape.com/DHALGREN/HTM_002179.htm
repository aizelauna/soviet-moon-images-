&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDeadly, in a playful kind of way. Quick movements exhibit a fighter's grace and ferocity. Dark hair, cut caesar style, is touched with grey at the temples. A silver stud pierces one ear. Thin mobile lips tease his words as he speaks. Under arched brows, his brown eyes are almost black - opaque as night, still every emotion, hot or cold, burns through.

Dark hair, cut caesar style is touched with grey at the temples. A silver stud pierces 
one ear. Thin mobile lips tease his words as he speaks. Under arched brows, his brown 
eyes are almost black - opaque as night, still every emotion, hot or cold, burns 
through. Black leather is a supple armor - black boots rise knee high, black leather 
pants fit tight and glistening, a black leather cycle jacket is scarred with zippers.
