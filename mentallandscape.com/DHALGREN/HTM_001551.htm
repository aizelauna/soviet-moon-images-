<H3> Kalessin (#1551)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_001223.htm">Generic Lycanthropic Thespian PC</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001551.htm">Kalessin</A>)

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspKalessin is extremely androgynous, so much so that it's difficult to look at em if you have a strong need for obvious genders.  E has the look about em of someone who is very used to being stared at.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLooking em up and down, you see eir hair cut short on one side of eir head and left long on the other.  A mustache exists only on the short haired side of eir face, and differences continue laterally as your gaze progresses vertically.  It's hard to tell what eir chest expresses, and eir hips are somewhere in between what you'd expect for a man or a woman.  Eir skin is fair, but ruddy, hairy but not, eir cheekbones are well-defined and slightly brutal, as is eir nose and eir chin.  There's no sign of there being or not being a prominent larynx on eir neck.  Nothing obvious pokes or sinks away, and eir body curves depend on how e stands.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspE looks as carefully at you as you look at em.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspE has a brass chain of mirrors, lenses and prisms wrapped around eir neck and waist.
