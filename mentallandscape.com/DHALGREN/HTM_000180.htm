&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou are standing in a large clearing in the park.  There is a fountain here, some picnic tables, and the ground is covered with a number of bedrolls and sleeping bags.  This seems to be a place where anyone is free to make their home.  A cinderblock furnace has been erected in the middle of the clearing.  A small fire smolders in it.  Rain drops sizzle as they fall into the furnace.  A gravel path extends to the east and west.  To the north are some public restrooms.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe steady beat of music can be heard from the southwest, beyond a hill.
<BR>
<BR>
You notice some details:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a stone basin of fairly clear water.  It at least looks clean enough to wash in.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You see a large cinderblock fire place.  Evidently used for communal cooking.
