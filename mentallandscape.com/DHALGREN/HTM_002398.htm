<H3> the Novelist (#2398)</H3>
(an instance of <A HREF="HTM_002383.htm">Generic Conversational Wandering Automaton</A> made by <A HREF="HTM_001457.htm">Trismegistos</A>)
<BR>
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA shortish, portly, bushy-bearded fellow with a cafe au lait complexion, wearing a plaid shirt and khaki trousers. He seems to be absorbed in his surroundings, scribbling in a 59-cent spiral notebook.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of hi:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :smiles. "Nice weather we're having."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :looks up and nods at visitor.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Well, hello there!
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of weather:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It's random, you know. The weather here.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Yes, the nice thing about the weather here is it's arbitrary. So nobody feels left out.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :looks up at the sky, quizzically.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of city:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp This city's seen better days, for sure.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :looks around. "Nobody's really sure what happened here, exactly. Though perhaps the exact details aren't as important as the prevailing standards of 'science fiction' would have it ..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp You'll find there's a strange benignity in the lawlessness of these ruins.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm a stranger here myself, of sorts.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Yes, hm ... well, you might call me one of the Founding Fathers of this confounding place ...
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of yes:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Exactly.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :nods.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Well, essentially.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Perhaps...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hm, but I can see another perspective on that.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of novel:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Actually, right now I'm just taking down notes, getting a feel for this place.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A novel would hardly do justice to this place ... I think. Unless it were a very exceptional one.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I do a little writing, here and there. Well, you might call it my life. Or one of my lives.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of Dhalgren:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp The name of the city isn't Dhalgren, you know. It's Bellona.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Dhalgren? Who knows? Maybe it's more intimately connected with yourself than you suspected.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp A lot of people want to know the 'meaning' of 'Dhalgren,' don't they?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Who or what 'Dhalgren' is, is not so important. In fact, I'm finding it's the least important thing about this place.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of do:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I really can't say ...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp That's up to you, I think.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :smiles, as if keeping a secret he doesn't want to keep.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Myself, I'd rather walk and talk than wonder.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of jeremy:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :smiles. "That Jeremy. He's easy to buy ... but his love ... that's a different story."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Yes, that's Jeremy all right.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of sun:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I have seen the sun, a bloated coal-red disk in the north at midnight.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of interesting:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp But it's not things that are interesting. It's people that are interested.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :waits for visitor to say something interesting.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I can't really speak on that subject. Everyone is different.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of bridge:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp It leads west, into a world you know, a place you may not know -- this bridge.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Some call it the Bridge of Lost Desire.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of book:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I take it you've read my other books, some of them, anyway.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Well, all my other books have been science fiction. The one I'm working on, about this place ... well, people will call it that, but it's more.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Have you written any books, yourself?
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of york:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hm...Bellona's not meant to be New York, actually. But everyone has their own archetypal City somewhere in their mind...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :looks a little nostalgic, as a memory crosses his mind.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of fiction:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :sighs, as if weary of shop talk.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Hm. But aren't we all participants in a kind of literary fiction?
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I think you'll agree that science fiction can be literature ... a para-literary genre, if you insist, but that term's just a cultural accident to begin with.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Well, what's your take on that topic? I'm curious.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of generic:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp :looks east. "I think I saw some generic objects in a box, over that way."
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist weighs in on the topic of TV:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp I'm a text person -- just not much of a media man.
<BR>
<BR>
the Novelist has some things to say:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Speech without content? Hm, I'll have to remember that.
