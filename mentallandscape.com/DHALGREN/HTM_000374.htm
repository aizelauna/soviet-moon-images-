&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOK, the Caveman is not really a player, he is an automaton (or a "bot" as some say). 
 To play with the caveman, try typing "feed caveman", "wake caveman" and "club caveman". 
 How he reacts will depend on his mood and on your gender.  Also, note that the description 
of the caveman can change.
