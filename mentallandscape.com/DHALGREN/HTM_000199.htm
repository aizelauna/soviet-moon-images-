&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA teenaged beauty with a slightly evil glint in her eye. She has shoulder length straight black hair, dark eyes, and slightly weathered skin tones. She is dressed in a loose white blouse, black tight pants and boots. From her belt hang long ribbons of 10 colors: white, red, blue, yellow, black, green, orange, grey, purple, and brown. Many pouches also hang from her belt, nestled near the long sword and scabbard there as well. Petite and lithe, she takes a seductive pose and eyes you warily and arrogantly.
