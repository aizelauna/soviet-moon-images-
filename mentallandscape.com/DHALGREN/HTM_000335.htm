&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspIt is very bright, open, and airy here, with large but broken plate-glass windows looking southward over an empty pool to weed-infested gardens beyond.  On the north wall, there is a rough stonework fireplace.  The east and west walls are almost completely covered with large, ransacked bookcases.  An exit in the northwest corner leads to a burned out area and, in a more northerly direction, to the entrance hall.  The door into the coat closet is boarded up, and at the south end is a broken sliding glass door leading out onto a wooden deck.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOn the mantelpiece is a cage containing the skeletal remains of a bird.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp  The room seems haunted by ghostly sounds.

<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspPaddington bonks Princess_Buttercup. Princess_Buttercup says, "There's something I ought to tell you...I'm not left handed..."
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp           ************* BOOOOOOOOOOOM!! *************
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBrianna hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugggggggggggggsss theo.  theo accepts a *BIG HUG*.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA huge finger comes down from the sky and points at BlueCanary.  A deep voice booms, "D O R K !"  The finger dissolves in a shower of light.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe housekeeper arrives to remove Beige_Guest.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA purple dinosaur?  OH, MY GOD!  Dodger has turned into BARNEY!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cockatoo wriggles out of the gag.  Cockatoo squawks, "Hello, everybody!"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptheo bravely gags the cockatoo, ignoring nipped fingers and frantic squawking.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCyndl holds up a BIG sign: | hey bri |
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSuddenly, and without warning, Bloomingdale's emits a enormous sneeze.  Huge amounts of mucous membrane, both liquid and solid, are spewn everywhere.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWintersong teleports Teal_Guest in.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBeige_Guest comes out of the closet (so to speak...).
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou see a faint shimmering force wrapping itself around theo and hugging him warmly...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspbagel attempts to walk through the plate-glass windows!  Fortunately, they're tougher than that.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA tiny, seemingly harmless cherrybomb lands on the ground with a echoing thud, bounces across the floor and rolls to a abrupt halt beneath Cyndl's feet. You jump behind a conveniently placed sofa, and wait for the blast.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cockatoo wriggles out of the gag.  Cockatoo squawks, "thank you Mr Clean"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspBlueCanary is torn asunder by the cherrybomb's destructive power. Tiny globs of gore and what used to be BlueCanary stick to the walls, bodies, and everywhere. GROSS!!!
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptheo holds his arm out to W0LFY, taking her by the hand, and leads her through a graceful waltz with all the style of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe cuckoo clock begins making a small whirring noise.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSchenider displays a big ol' silly banner reading:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspCockatoo squawks, "hello everybody, I'm new"
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou sense the comforting presence of Yellow_Guest as he hugs you tightly in a distant, yet warm embrace...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspUnable to control it any longer, Yellow_Guest lets fly with the most enormous fart.  PPhhhppppppprrbbbbbbttt.  Aaahhh.  A green cloud rises from Yellow_Guest's general direction.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEvil_Twin is starting to turn green as he grabs his stomach.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWith an awful sound, Evil_Twin vomits all over the floor.  It is the most disgusting display of bad ettiquete you have ever seen!
