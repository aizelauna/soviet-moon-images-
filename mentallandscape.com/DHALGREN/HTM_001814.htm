&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspYou stand at the peak of a large mountain. In every direction, the mountain range extends as far as you can see. The air is thin up here, but as refreshing as any you have ever breathed. The sky seems so close to you, you almost believe you could just jump and find yourself flying. In the ground at your feet is inset a translucent white disc.

&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp Above you, you see clouds, birds, and sky.
