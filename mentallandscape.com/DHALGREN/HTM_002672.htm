<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      There's no sound inside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA strange liquid fills everything, but you breath easly. The 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsptemperature is...perfect. Not cold, not hot, not even warm. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust perfect. So perfect you forget it.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      There's no light inside.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp   
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspNothing to touch. Except the walls, but those are never near, 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspand you end up forgetting about them. No floor, no ceiling. 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspJust space...empty space, but for the liquid and the notion of 
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspyou.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp      There's you in here.
