&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDebris has been pushed back against the walls and against the edge of the balcony--in fact on that side it reaches to the ceiling. A large, canopied bed sits against the far wall just below the monumental rose, stained glass window. A table and several comfortable chairs are laid out in front of a fireplace which has been cobbled together from slabs of marble. A few kelim rugs--probably looted from finer stores grace the floors.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe loft if flooded with brilliantly colored light as the sun shines through the ruins of the stained glass windows. The curtains of the bed glow bloody in the sunlight.
<BR>
<BR>
You see <A HREF="HTM_000215.htm">Kashka</A> here.

EXITS:
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp [ down ] <A HREF="HTM_000177.htm">Ruined Church</A>.
You carefully pick your way through the debris down to the nave.
<BR>
<BR>
This place has a certain ambiance...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe fire crackles sullenly on the marble hearth. Sparks fly up into the air
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA large piece of red glass falls lazily from the eastern windows...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspGlass crashes to the floor--far below--with a startling explosion of sound.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDebris shifts on the stairway causing a cloud of dust to engulf the loft.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspthe Curtains of the canopied bed rustle in a ghostly wind.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspOrgan music hovers mysteriously in the air.  You see a luminous figure...
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspSaint Camber appears and glides towards you. Or. Was it your imagination.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspA suddden wind howls through the nave of the church below you.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspDust skitters along the floor and faint rustling noises issue from the wall
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFirelight blazes on the ruined walls of the choirloft.
<BR>
&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspFrom the church below comes the sound of stealthly footsteps.
