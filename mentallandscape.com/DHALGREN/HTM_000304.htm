&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspEvery inch of space here is being used for storage. The walls are lined with industrial shelving, which is crammed with cleaning supplies, various tarps and chains, and sacks of Purina Camel Chow. A large metal freezer is backed up against the southern wall. A neatly folded stack of blankets sits in the corner.
