Many researchers associate virtual reality with fancy 3D technology: head-mounted displays, realtime hardware rendering, the disappointing VRML standard, etc.  Text-based role-playing games have been around since the late 1970s, and their users are actually the first people to have experienced immersion in multi-user virtual worlds.
<P>
In 1987,
<A HREF="http://www.cs.yale.edu/homes/aspnes/">Jim Aspnes</A>
wrote and deployed a social world called TinyMUD, where users can freely build new content.  His program was extended by
<A HREF="http://www.csclub.uwaterloo.ca/u/sfwhite/">Stephen White</A>,
who wrote the scriptable TinyMUCK system, and the object-oriented MOO system.  Researchers at Xerox PARC refined White's work and hosted a large world called <I>LambdaMOO</I>.
<P>
In January 1994, I built a small MOO at Princeton, called <I>Dhalgren</I>, inspired by the science fiction of 
<A HREF="http://www.pcc.com/~jay/delany/">Samuel Delany</A> and William Burroughs.  When I moved to Microsoft a year later, Dhalgren had 500 users.  I couldn't host it from a corporate network, so Microsoft gave a computer to Prof. 
<A HREF="http://www.dhalgren.com/">Steve Shaviro</A> at UW's English Dept. It was marked down as a 'moving expenses for employee's family'.
<P>
In the mid '90s, Dhalgren was a well-known MOO, respected for its dark, literary style.  Besides my references to Delany and Burroughs, a grad student from Portland created a haunted carnival, a grad student from Brown added to the Delany theme and played the role of Kid, and an English professor from Rutgers created a theater featuring Japanese plays and poetry.
<P>
Technically, Dhalgren was simple, clean and innovative.  The Post-Apocalypse Room class could modify descriptions for night and day and for weather.  The Scorpion Player class allowed users to wear holographic costumes.  A Listening Automaton had a simple language parser and a finite-state-machine brain.  In general, I tried to create a new streamlined set of basic classes, drawn from experiences on LambdaMOO, but without its vast clutter of superfluous code.
<P>
