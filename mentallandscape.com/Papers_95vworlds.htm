<P align=justify>Virtual reality is a computer interface in which the user feels 
immersed in an artificial space containing representations of data, programs and 
other users. Despite heavily funded research on immersive computer graphics, the 
most impressive and complete realization of VR has been multi-user text-based 
games called MUDs. The sense of immersion on a MUD is imagined rather than 
sensory, but fast 3D game graphics on PCs suggest that it is technically 
feasible to make a MUD-like virtual world with a visual interface. Ideally, 
graphics would make virtual reality more vivid and accessible without hindering 
the activity and community found on text-based systems.</P>

  <P align=justify>Virtual reality and cyberspace are popular, compelling 
  concepts. It is becoming feasible for users to interface with computers by 
  immersing themselves in an artificial space containing objects of interest and 
  other users. This is an extension of the current trend to allow users to 
  access and manipulate data directly, hiding the intervening nuts and bolts of 
  the computer itself. And since we live and dream in three dimensions, virtual 
  reality seems to be a potentially natural and rich interface metaphor. Because 
  other users are present in these spaces, social interaction and virtual 
  communities are enabled.</P>
  <P align=justify>Unlike the 2D desk-top interface, three-dimensional 
  interfaces can create an experience of <I>immersion. </I>Under the right 
  circumstances, users are able to mentally project themselves into a virtual 
  space. One way this has been accomplished has been with 3D graphics; for 
  example, the <I>DOOM </I>game. Another demonstration of immersion has been 
  with MUDs, which are based purely on textual description. MUDs show that a 
  rich, consistent presentation of a virtual space, even without sophisticated 
  display technology, can be vividly experienced in the imagination of the user. 
  </P>
  <P align=justify>The idea of virtual reality is at least 50 years old. 
  Vannevar Bush proposed many of the basic concepts in 1945, when computers were 
  still in the vacuum-tube era. He suggested that vast amounts of information 
  would be stored in machines and that people might interface with these 
  machines in increasingly intimate ways, including direct induction of images 
  on the optical nerve. Ivan Sutherland built the first head-mounted displays in 
  the late 1960s. In the 1980s, science fiction stimulated a great deal of 
  popular and professional interest by presenting provocative scenarios of 
  virtual reality computer interfaces:</P><I>
  <P align=justify>His first stop was Mass Transmit 3. Physically, MT3 was a 
  two-thousand-tonne satellite in synchronous orbit over the Indian Ocean. ...in 
  the Other Plane it was represented as a five-meter-wide ledge near the top of 
  a mountain that rose from the forests and swamps that stood for the lower 
  satellite layer and the ground-based nets.</P>
  <P align=justify>- True Names, </I>Vernor Vinge (1980)</P>
  <P align=justify>The most literal-minded research on virtual reality has 
  focused on the problems of display technology and geometrical modeling. Head 
  mounted displays and $150,000 Silicon Graphics workstations make great demos 
  and attract funding, but these efforts have failed to demonstrate an 
  affordable or even a very interesting virtual world. The state of the art in 
  computer graphics is not yet able to generate visually compelling content 
  without enlisting the user’s imagination. To do that, there must be a 
  well-constructed, consistent model of a world on the other side of the 
  display.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>In 1978, the first text-based, multi-user adventure games, 
  called MUDs, appeared; and by the late 1980s, these systems had evolved into 
  the most sophisticated demonstration of virtual reality. MUDs represent a 
  world of interconnected rooms, populated by active objects and avatars 
  representing users. Actions and descriptions are displayed only via text, but 
  users learn do develop a vivid experience of immersion in a virtual space as 
  they read and type. As computer programs, MUDs represent an underground 
  evolution of operating systems based on persistent, active objects. As virtual 
  worlds, MUDs have encountered and solved many of the technical and social 
  problems of how to immerse users, structure virtua space, and manage 
  communities.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>The most successful MUDs, such as FurryMUCK or LambdaMOO, are 
  thriving communities of 9000 or more users. Some are still structured as 
  violent adventure games requiring considerable time and effort, and others are 
  purely social spaces where users are free to build and interact. Any effort to 
  construct virtual worlds must not ignore the lessons offered by these 
  text-based environments.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=256 src="Papers_95vworlds_Image60.gif" 
  width=568></P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>While MUDs demonstrate the importance of underlying structure 
  versus display technology, it is also true that reading and typing text can be 
  burdensome. World-Wide-Web browsers like Netscape and Mosaic have demonstrated 
  that users enjoy building and exploring multimedia environments. Computer 
  games like <I>DOOM </I>or <I>Virtua Fighter</I> have demonstrated that 
  affordable computers can generate interesting 3D graphics. Users enjoy the 
  immersiveness of 3D games, and the limited resolution of these graphics 
  indicate the importance of having an underlying context of interest.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>The technology seems to be present today, but many attempts 
  to combine MUDs, the World Wide Web, and 3D graphics seem ill-conceived. 
  ChibaMOO and some other MUDs have WWW interfaces that allow users to augment 
  descriptions of objects with audio or GIF-formated images; however, the web 
  protocol itself seems fatally flawed by its inability to allow efficient 
  interactively between clients and servers. The VRML project seeks to augment 
  the web protocol with a geometrical modeling language for describing 3D 
  spaces, but the lack of multi-user interaction makes this typical of many 
  other display-centered approaches.</P>
  <P align=justify></P>
  <P align=justify>This report discusses and advocates an approach strongly 
  grounded in MUD systems. The goal is to understand what makes MUDs successful 
  and to suggest ways to augment that experience with graphics. </P>
  <P align=justify>&nbsp;</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=5>
  <LI>Learning From MUDs </B></FONT><FONT size=2>
  <P align=justify>MUDs are the most tangible example of virtual worlds that we 
  can find and study today. The "display technology" of MUDs is simply text, and 
  so the experience of virtual space is imagined rather than sensory. 
  Nevertheless, for a small, readerly audience of users, MUDs are rich and 
  immersive. By avoiding the difficult problems of computer graphics, MUDs have 
  been free to explore other aspects of virtual worlds; how to structure space, 
  how to represent the user in the space, and how to deal with behavior and 
  community.</P>
  <P align=justify>MUDs began as multi-user text adventure games, but in 1987, 
  Jim Aspnes at CMU made a critical change. He threw away the game-play aspect 
  and simply allowed users to freely describe themselves, build on to the space 
  and socialize with each other. His <I>TinyMUD</I> system spread across the 
  internet like a virus and rapidly evolved into complex programmable systems. 
  This section will discuss how social MUDs create a sense of space, how the 
  user is embodied and active in these spaces, and how a sense of community is 
  sometimes achieved.</P>
  <OL></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>How MUDs Define A Virtual Space </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <P align=justify>The first impression a user has of a MUD is the space 
    itself, and exploring it will set their sense of where they are and whether 
    or not they want to stay. The structure of space in a MUD is similar to what 
    was found in early single-user text adventure games, like Crowther’s 
    original <I>ADVENT</I> game. In addition to being multi-user, current MUDs 
    are designed to allow on-line users to build onto the game.</P>
    <P align=justify>In <I>TinyMUD</I>, complex worlds were constructed from 
    four simple object types: rooms, exits, things and players. All objects had 
    a set of basic properties such as a name, a full-length description, a 
    contents list (what is in a room or what a player is carrying), and 
    activation messages. Later versions of this program (e.g., TinyMUCK, 
    TinyMUSE, and MOO) included full programmability of object behavior.</P>
    <P align=justify>The virtual space itself is defined by a network of rooms 
    interconnected by exits. The room object contained players and things. When 
    a user entered a room (by moving their player object there), its description 
    would be displayed, suggesting their presence in a place. On more advanced 
    MUDs, room descriptions are more dynamic, showing players sitting on 
    furniture for example. Text can evoke sights, sounds, smells and 
    emotions:</P><I>
    <P>Nocturne</P>
    <P align=justify>Moonlight pours through an open window, as rain beats a 
    steady patter on the balcony to the west. The floor is a patchwork of 
    dark-coloured stones, the walls a solid ebon rock, gleaming with a lunar 
    glow. The large bed lies unmade, soft pearl duvets shimmering with a chill 
    draught, making it seem all the more seductive.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>The user navigates by typing the names of exits that 
    connect the room they’re in to other rooms. In the example above, the 
    description suggests the existence of an exit called "WEST" which would lead 
    to the balcony. An activation message can be printed when the user moves, 
    describing the journey. Exits also have a description which the user sees if 
    they type "LOOK WEST".</P>
    <P align=justify>Some rooms in a MUD become important gathering places where 
    users can rendezvous or just hang around and meet people. The creators of a 
    MUD may attempt to define these spaces. but it’s hard to determine where 
    users will choose to hang out. On the original TinyMUD, a village square was 
    designed to be the social nexus, but in fact a room created by one of the 
    users soon became the heart of the MUD:</P><I>
    <P>THIS is the Rec Room!!!!</P>
    <P align=justify>This large, darkened room has no obvious exits. A crowd 
    relaxes on pillows in front of a giant screen TV, and there is a fully 
    stocked fridge and a bar. By the TV is a black box with buttons marked with 
    the numbers 2 through 13 and the letter U. A glass phone booth stands in the 
    corner.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>While the <I>Rec Room </I>says it has no obvious exits, in 
    fact hundreds of exits connected this location to all the major sites on the 
    MUD, and the owner of this room wielded the power to grant permission to 
    link exits to other user’s rooms. This room was a social meeting place, a 
    navigational hub, and a source of political power for its owner. Even though 
    there is no game play, part of the effort in being on a social MUD is to 
    make spaces that will be admired and used.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial

    <LI>Navigation: A Walk In Islandia </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>Users navigate on a MUD by looking and going through exits. 
    To illustrate this, here is a short transcript of a walk through an early 
    TinyMUD called <I>Islandia</I>, which was shut down in November of 1990. 
    User input is denoted in capital letters after a "&gt;" prompt. Notice that 
    some exits don’t actually go anywhere! In the example below, "SIT" and the 
    last instance of "WEST" are simply used to generate an evocative 
    message:</P><I>
    <P>&gt;LOOK</P>
    <P>Town Square</P>
    <P align=justify>A large oak tree spreads its branches over a wooden kiosk 
    covered with announcements in the grassy center of the square. Park benches 
    line the sidewalks amidst flowery shrubs. You see the library to the 
    northwest, the post office to the southeast, the homeless shelter to the 
    southwest, and the hotel and convention hall to the northwest.</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;SIT</P>
    <P align=justify>You sit down on a park bench.</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;LOOK WEST</P>
    <P align=justify>The duck pond is to the west, and banners and pennants are 
    beyond it. Lucky for you, there is a wooden bridge upon which you can cross, 
    if you can get past the horrendous crowd on it.</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;WEST</P>
    <P align=justify>You head for the bridge, hoping to push your way 
across.</P>
    <P align=justify>Crowded Wooden Bridge</P>
    <P align=justify>You stand in a huge crush of people trying to cross a nasty 
    wooden bridge to the other side of the duck pond. There is a mermaid beneath 
    the bridge, and a very nasty beggar whom you must pass to go west. Maybe 
    he’ll not notice you.</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;LOOK DOWN</P>
    <P align=justify>It’s a steep climb, but you could probably make it. 
    Besides, there’s the mermaid down there.</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;WEST</P>
    <P align=justify>The slimy beggar gets in your way. Alms! Alms for a slimy 
    beggar!</P>
    <P align=justify>&gt;PAY</P>
    <P align=justify>You drop a coin into the beggar’s cup, feeling rather 
    charitable, and he allows you to pass west with many cries of a thousand 
    thanks, noble lord!</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Navigational Aids</LI></OL></LI></OL></B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>Virtual spaces can easily become vast and complex. On some 
MUDs, the user can easily teleport to any known location or the location of any 
user. Experienced users often prefer this, since they have already explored the 
space extensively. Some MUDs try to encourage more themely forms of 
transportation and give some guidance to interesting places. FurryMUCK, in the 
course of its six years of operation, has developed a number of interesting 
navigational aids and guides:</P>
<UL>
  <UL>
    <P align=justify>
    <LI>Step disks are exits placed along long streets to allow large steps. For 
    example the exit "NORTH" might go one block north, but a step disk called 
    "NN" might go six blocks. 
    <P></P>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <LI>The taxi is a special room that can be reached from anywhere by typing 
    "TAXI". Inside, a sign indicates the names of exits to interesting locations 
    like "EC" to reach Equine Central. The taxi is handy as a shortcut for 
    experience users, and a list of interesting places to visit for new users. 
    <P></P>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <LI>Users can carry other users from place to place. 
    <P></P>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <LI>Users can type "HOME" at any time to return to their designated home 
    room. 
    <P></P>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <LI>Teleport rings allow the user to record interesting room locations and 
    return to them later. On some MUDs, this function has simply been built into 
    the player object itself, and users can teleport without any kind of virtual 
    device. 
    <P></P></LI></UL></UL>
<OL>
  <OL></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Things </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2><I>
    <P align=justify>Things</I> are objects that can be located in a room or 
    carried by a user. On TinyMUD, they were mainly persistent objects that 
    could be used as props, containers, food, clothing, gifts (rings, flowers, 
    etc) or simply act as amusing ornaments like this strange object kept in the 
    <I>Rec Room:</P>
    <P>icky thing</P>
    <P align=justify>This icky thing is slimy and sticky and nasty and stinky. 
    Dust and unidentifiable crud sticks to the outside. Your stomach lurches 
    just knowing this thing exists in the same universe as you. Gross! You think 
    you saw it move, just a tiny bit..</P></I>
    <P align=justify>On the first social muds, things acting as notes were 
    placed in a post office to send asynchronous messages to other users. In 
    later MUDs, internal email, bulletin boards and newspapers were implemented 
    and formed an important part of the community life on these systems.</P>
    <P align=justify>In later MUDs, things (and other objects) could be 
    programmed to respond to commands and to the environment. One of the most 
    complex type of programmed objects is the <I>automaton </I>or "bot". For 
    example, when a user (such as Nigel) enters Equine Central on FurryMUCK, 
    they are greeted by a bot:</P><I>
    <P>Nigel walks in through the doorway to the south.</P>
    <P align=justify>Honey the EC Receptionist looks up from her hay-munching 
    with a grassy mouthful and her eyes go wide upon seeing Nigel. She pitui’s 
    out the unchewed hay and welcomes him to Equine Central.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>Automatons range from simple "Eliza" programs that respond 
    in a primitive way to speech to complex finite state machines that can mimic 
    people or animals with changing moods and descriptions. They are used to 
    simulate pets, waiters, chiming clocks, you name it.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT 
    face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>The User’s Virtual Body </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>Player objects (or "avatars" as some call them) represent 
    the users themselves within the virtual space. In some sense, the player 
    acts as a cursor, defining the current location and viewpoint of the user 
    and the "room focus" where communication occurs. Players have a description 
    that is viewable by other users, and people take great delight in designing 
    the appearance of their player.</P>
    <P align=justify>Many users seem to project themselves into a virtual space, 
    in their own imagination, and inhabit the body defined by the player. By 
    setting the description of a player, and subsequently controlling its 
    behavior on the MUD, users construct a persona which may be quite different 
    from their real-world selves. It is not unusual for people to have a player 
    with a different gender or even a different species. Here are a few examples 
    of player descriptions:</P><I>
    <P>legba</P>
    <P align=justify>Wearing, as usual, a borrowed body. She sails about, this 
    one, massive and magnificent as an antique schooner, wearing a muumuu bright 
    with flowers of a variety and color not often found together in nature. Her 
    heavy-Lidded imperious gaze fixes you for a moment and her mouth compressed 
    in what might be either manifest disapproval or suppressed amusement. Her 
    hair floats in a frowzy black halo around her face. She has a deep, rich 
    laugh and very small feet which are usually wedged into pink mules.</P>
    <P align=justify></P>
    <P align=justify>Nigel Unicorn</P>
    <P align=justify>Standing 16.2 hands, Nigel Unicorn stands before you, 
    Blacker than black, blacker than the darkest night, blacker than the deepest 
    mine, blacker than the deepest space. The one touch of color that breaks the 
    darkness of his form are his eyes which depending on the light, shift in 
    color from gold and green, blue and red. His horn appears to be spiraled in 
    shape, about 30cm long and similarly black, but the longer you stare at it 
    the more disoriented you become, and you feel as if you are being drawn from 
    yourself, pulled from here to....somewhere.</P>
    <P align=justify>While stocky in build Nigel moves gracefully and when he 
    notices you watching him he prances around a bit proudly shaking his long 
    mane and flipping his tail. He greets you with a happy whistle, and whickers 
    gently to you, happy to make your acquaintance.</P></I>
    <P align=justify>"legba" is a graduate student in literary theory, and her 
    descriptions are vivid and amusing. "Nigel" is an electrician in real life, 
    and his player is a classic example of a "Furry", a strange but popular 
    subculture of MUD enthusiasts who role play anthropomorphic 
    animals.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Schmoos, Furries, And Genderfuck </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>On chat lines, like IRC, users are not well embodied in a 
    virtual space. Literary theorists will claim that the on-going discourse of 
    a chat line does construct a world and user bodies, but these constructions 
    are ephemeral. MUDs allow a persistent definition of identity and of virtual 
    body. Experience with MUDs seems to indicate that some users enhance their 
    sense of immersion by increasing the sophistication of their simulated body. 
    Other users find embodiment in virtual reality to be a disturbing 
    concept.</P>
    <P align=justify>One of the largest MUDs on the internet is <I>LambdaMOO, 
    </I>a MUD run by Xerox PARC. In 1993, a major social upheaval illustrated 
    some of the controversy and emotion surrounding players and the embodiment 
    of users in virtual reality. The controversy centered around a very 
    sophisticated player object programmed by a user known as Quinn. The 
    <I>Schmoo Player Class, </I>and a later version called the <I>Revenant 
    Player Class </I>allowed the user to construct a virtual body with more 
    flexibility than a static paragraph of text.</P>
    <P align=justify>This player class had separate body parts which could be 
    described individually: head, chest, arms, hands, groin, legs and feet. When 
    you looked at one of these players, you would see the concatenation of these 
    descriptions. Usually this was a description of a nude body, but this player 
    class could wear clothing that would selectively cover parts of the body (or 
    other items of under clothing) and replace those portions of the description 
    with a clothing description.</P>
    <P align=justify>This player class became extremely popular and challenged 
    the rulers of LambdaMOO in two ways. First, Quinn himself became politically 
    powerful as the leader of the schmoo players. Secondly, this player class 
    forgrounded the controversial activity of virtual sex. The schmoo clothing 
    items were programmed to generate messages associated with dressing, 
    undressing or being stripped by other players. Some users objected strongly 
    to the practice of virtual sex. Eventually, Quinn was expelled from 
    LambdaMOO. The subsequent popular protest not only resulted in Quinn’s 
    return, but ultimately lead to the replacement of the oligarchy of rulers 
    with a democratic form of government on that MUD.</P>
    <P align=center><IMG height=409 src="Papers_95vworlds_Image61.jpg" 
    width=512></P>
    <P align=justify>Another example of strong embodiment in virtual reality are 
    the so-called Furries. This subculture first appeared on the original 
    TinyMUD as a group of users who described themselves as anthropormophic 
    animals. They were somewhat controversial, and eventually formed their own 
    MUD called <I>FurryMUCK</I>, which today is one of the largest and oldest 
    MUDs on the internet (about 6000 users). Furries go to great length to 
    create sensual bodies; sleek fur, slitted pupils, sharp claws. FurryMUCK is 
    a remarkably friendly, playful MUD with a strong identity as a 
community.</P>
    <P align=justify>Users can become quite emotionally involved in the creation 
    and inhabitation of their player. On a MUD called <I>Post Modern 
    Culture</I>, a group of artists decided that users were creating players 
    that were too cliché and representational. As an artistic and political 
    experiment, they decided to programatically alter the gender and appearance 
    of players. Users protested strongly, referring to this experiment as 
    "genderfuck", and many of them simply left the MUD.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT 
    face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Communication and Gesture </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>Users on MUDs communicate with text messages, usually 
    broadcast to the players contained within the same room. As in chat systems, 
    users can simply talk, but an important style of communication that emerged 
    on TinyMUD is <I>emoting, </I>where a player describes a gesture in the 
    third person. For example, if we were operating a player called Bob, we 
    might see the following simple exchange:</P><I>
    <P>&gt;SAY HELLO EVERYONE!</P>
    <P>Bob says, "Hello everyone!"</P>
    <P>Alice says, "Hi Bob. How’s it going?"</P>
    <P>&gt;EMOTE SITS DOWN AND SIGHS.</P>
    <P>Bob sits down and sighs.</P>
    <P>Alice looks concerned.</P>
    <P>Alice says, "What’s wrong Bob?"</P></I>
    <P align=justify>Emoting is a particularly interesting communication feature 
    of MUDs that allows users to narrate about themselves in the third person, 
    rather than communicate in the form of speaking (as in a chat system). 
    Emoting is an important mechanism for MUD users to construct imaginary state 
    about the world, an imaginary action or their state of mind.</P>
    <P align=justify>Here is a sample of some MUD communication between two 
    friends (and some other bystanders) on FurryMUCK:</P><I>
    <P>Trevor says, "I live in the Woody Willow north of Feline Park."</P>
    <P>Nigel whips out a map from his saddle bag and lays it on the ground 
    puzzling over the best route to Trevor’s treehouse.</P>
    <P>Trevor just reheated some left-over Spanish rice and seafood.</P>
    <P>Nigel sniffs at the food trying to determine if it would be good for a 
    unicorn... satisfied that it at least wouldn’t kill him he buries his muzzle 
    in the pot and gulps it all down...</P>
    <P>Trevor eeps! Then laughs.</P>
    <P>Nigel says, "Let’s see if I take the step disks for 5 stations north of 
    the park turn east, leap to BoingDragon’s jump room, and call a taxi to the 
    acme Truth or Dare pool hang a right and fly straight up to the west corner 
    of the part I should be able.... hmmm why don’t you just carry me."</P>
    <P>Rena winks at Nigel.</P>
    <P>Nigel whickers hello to Rena.</P>
    <P>Nigel canters around Trever in a small circle...</P>

    <P align=justify>A surprising amount of communication on MUDs is in the form 
    of emotes. In combat adventure MUDs, emoting was not allowed, because users 
    could use it to subvert the simulation of the game. Casting spells and 
    wielding weapons were controlled by special commands, and it was felt that 
    arbitrary emoting could disrupt the consensual illusion of the world (e.g., 
    by emoting the launch of a nuclear weapon in a bronze-age setting). Users 
    still manage to emote by subverting activation 
    messages.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>MUDs And Community </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>Successful MUDs have evolved beyond being games or 
    "interactive fiction" to become large, long-lived communities on the 
    internet. FurryMUCK has about 6000 users and has been on-line since 1990. 
    LambdaMOO came up about a year later and has about 9000 users today. Chat 
    lines and bulletin boards also popular, but they lack a virtual geography to 
    explore or create mood, and chat lines even lack persistent player 
    identities.</P>
    <P align=justify>The Doblin Group, a prominent Chicago consulting firm, 
    recently completed a million-dollar effort to research the concept of 
    community. They condensed a mountain of published research into six 
    properties measuring the strength of a community: effort, purpose, identity, 
    organic, adaptive, freedom.</P>
    <P align=justify>A problem with chat lines is the total lack of 
    <I>effort</I>, obligation and responsibility on the part of the user. They 
    log in to be amused and can be rude or simply disconnect the moment they get 
    bored. MUDs are stronger in this area because the user has a persistent 
    player and perhaps other artifacts they have built. Although the user is 
    usually anonymous, they have an investment in their player, and they have an 
    incentive to be popular and creative in order to get the most out of the 
    MUD.</P>
    <P align=justify>MUDs generally lack a strong sense of <I>purpose</I>, 
    except as a game or meeting place for friends. Attempts to build MUDs around 
    some goal like the MIT Media Lab’s MOO, which was designed to bring 
    researchers together, have generally not been very successful. Thus far, 
    those MUDs have simply been too boring to attract and stimulate people.</P>
    <P align=justify>MUDs vary in their sense of <I>identity</I>. Most have a 
    theme, particularly the adventure-game MUDs, and users often have a sense of 
    pride in one or two particular MUDs after they have invested time there. The 
    one outstanding example of a MUD with a strong sense of identity is 
    FurryMUCK. Furries view themselves as a counter culture. They meet in real 
    life at large conferences, they have generated an enormous collection of 
    artwork, poetry and short stories which can be accessed via their web page 
    (www.furry.com), and some of them even live together in urban communes known 
    as "Furry houses".</P>
    <P align=justify>Early MUDs were games with an inflexible structure designed 
    by their owner/authors. Companies like <I>Simutronics</I> still produce such 
    systems, but they lack the <I>organic</I>, co-constructed nature of modern 
    internet MUDs. The Schmoo Player Class or The Rec Room are good examples of 
    the rich and unexpected phenomena that have resulted from end-user authoring 
    and community feedback.</P>
    <P align=justify>Are MUDs very <I>adaptive</I>? As computer systems, perhaps 
    not. So far, the technology has not scaled well to large communities because 
    MUDs are based on centralized servers. While distributed MUDs have been 
    attempted, this has proven to be too difficult for the creative but 
    inexperienced programmers who develop MUD servers. As communities, some MUDs 
    have survived for as long as six years. Personality clashes, anti-social 
    users, and power struggles occur on almost all MUDs, and some of them fail 
    as a result.</P>
    <P align=justify>One of the great attractions of MUDs is the <I>freedom</I> 
    it gives users to transcend almost any limitation of the real world. Uses 
    can define a body and personality for themselves, they can create fantastic 
    places or objects, and they can explore social interaction. At the same 
    time, most MUDs do not have a free form of internal government, and in the 
    worst cases, players are subject to the petty whims of the MUD rulers.</P>
    <P align=justify>As communities, MUDs vary in quality, but there is clearly 
    a strong potential. A few examples, like FurryMUCK, have a powerful sense of 
    community, and some users act like loyal citizens of a virtual world. Some 
    MUDs are simply games, although combat adventure MUDs can have a sense of 
    community. Users socialize and even fall in love on some of those 
    game-oriented systems. Many large social MUDs, like Xerox PARC’s LambdaMOO, 
    do not have as strong a sense of community as FurryMUCK, but its users feel 
    a sense of pioneering, and public political forums stimulate 
    involvement.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Newbies </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>I played for a short while on <I>MUD II</I>, the original 
    English MUD, and pretty much died the moment I stepped out of the safety of 
    the "Elizabethan Tea Room". My player’s name was "Patroclus", a prince from 
    the <I>Iliad</I>, and within minutes of logging in, someone paged me with 
    "Hector is coming to get you!" (Hector killed Patroclus in Homer’s epic). 
    The users were educated, arrogant and displayed a complex mix of cruelty and 
    fair play. New users on a combat MUD are called "newbies", British 
    boarding-school slang, and they are sometimes helped and sometimes 
    humiliated by more experienced players.</P>
    <P align=justify>Social MUDs are not this bad, but on a poorly-managed MUD 
    like LambdaMOO, a newbie may find it hard to get help, may be treated rudely 
    by some players, and will find it difficult to build new spaces in an old 
    MUD with an overly full database. FurryMUCK is still a very positive 
    experience for new users, and the attitude is extremely helpful and 
    friendly. On Dhalgren, a MUD run by the author, an entertaining tutorial, in 
    the form of a cave to be explored, was constructed to help orient new 
    users.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Summary Of MUDs</LI></OL></OL></B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify></P>
<P align=justify>Unlike chat systems, MUDs support an explicit representation of 
virtual space. The user is situated in rooms or areas with descriptions, often 
via direct second-person address ("You stand in a huge crush of people..."). The 
space is populated by objects which can be looked at, picked up, carried around 
and dropped. It is also populated by avatars of other users who can also be 
looked at. Users navigate this space by typing directions to walk in, taking 
them from room to room. As spaces become large, additional mechanisms need to be 
added for users to discover and travel to places of interest.</P>
<P align=justify>MUDs represent the user as a player object in the virtual 
space, providing a persistent identity with a name and description. Users enjoy 
creating the appearance and behavior of a new persona, and viewing other players 
increases the sense of being immersed in an inhabited space. Embodiment is 
enhanced for some users by player objects with more structure (clothing and body 
parts). Friendship and sex both occur in virtual spaces.</P>
<P align=justify>Users communicate and gesture with text, and the most powerful 
communication device invented on MUDs is the emote. Emoting allows users to 
augment talking with third-person statements that indicate moods, thoughts and 
actions. Combat MUDs attempt to repress emoting to enforce consistency with the 
game, while on social MUDs, emoting accounts for about half of people’s 
communication.</P>
<P align=justify>Some MUDs, like FurryMUCK, have become large, long-lived 
communities. MUDs are free and organic, allowing users to socialize, explore and 
create. Because the space and the players have some persistence, these 
communities require some effort to make friends and invest in the development of 
an interesting player. Some, but not all MUDs have a strong sense of identity 
and purpose. Attracting and entertaining new users is also an important issue to 
keep in mind.</P>

  <LI>From Imagined To Sensory Immersion </B></FONT><FONT size=2>
  <P align=justify>The technology exists today to create a more direct, sensory 
  experience of immersion in a virtual space, but thus far, there has not been 
  much experience with how to apply this technology. Text can be highly 
  evocative, but there is much to be said about showing the user what a virtual 
  space is like instead of making them read about it. People can absorb visual 
  information rapidly and effortlessly, and moving rapidly through a space is 
  thrilling. The remainder of this report discusses some of the experiments and 
  questions about how to use graphics in the representation of a virtual 
  world.</P>

    <LI>3D Simulations And Games </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>The immersiveness of 3D graphics was repeatedly 
    demonstrated in <I>SIMNET</I>, a large military war-game simulation system 
    that combined flight and tank simulators in multi-user exercises. The tank 
    simulators allowed the user to drive around in a 3D virtual environment of 
    textured terrain, vehicles, explosions and smoke clouds. The graphics 
    display itself was only 320 by 200 pixels drawn at 15 frames per second. In 
    addition, there was an audio communication system that simulated battlefield 
    radio.</P>
    <P align=justify>An interesting lesson learned from SIMNET was that the 
    users felt immersed even though the display had a rather poor resolution. 
    Soldiers still found the system thrilling to use, and they "saw through the 
    technology", as one expert described. The 3D world was comprehensible and 
    consistent, and the user’s imagination could fill in the missing resolution. 
    The overall experience was also enhanced by the interaction with team 
    members over the radio.</P>

    <P align=center>A courtyard scene from <I>DOOM</P></I>
    <P align=justify>The popular PC gamed, <I>DOOM</I>, was a revolutionary 
    development that took graphics researchers and the game-playing public 
    completely by surprise. This program allowed the user to walk through a 3D 
    world, using only a 33 Mhz 80486 processor and VGA frame buffer of a common 
    PC. Two key inventions made this possible: a restriction of the 3D geometry 
    that allowed visibility to be computed in two dimensions, and a clever 
    texture-mapping algorithm that rendered surfaces in perspective along lines 
    of constant distance.</P><I>
    <P align=justify>DOOM</I> is an example of a <I>full 3D graphics</I>, where 
    the user can walk anywhere and look in any direction. Motion is restricted 
    to the two dimensions of the ground, using the arrow keys to turn left or 
    right and walk forwards or backwards. Objects are picked up by running over 
    them, and devices (switches, doors) are activated by standing in front of 
    them and pressing the space bar. It is a multi-user game, and the players 
    (and objects and monsters) are represented as <I>2D sprites</I>. The user 
    sees the world in <I>first person</I>, viewing the world through the eyes of 
    their player.</P>

    <P align=center>A Western saloon scene from <I>Alone In The Dark</P></I>
    <P align=justify>A different approach to visualizing a 3D world is taken by 
    the game <I>Alone In The Dark</I>. This game shows the player in a 
    <I>third-person </I>view instead of through his eyes. Space is represented 
    as <I>2D artwork</I>, drawn in proper perspective, and the player and other 
    objects are represented by articulated 3D geometry. The user can move the 
    player with the arrow keys, just as in <I>DOOM, </I>but the view of the 
    world is made up of discrete pieces of art presented as different camera 
    shots of the world.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>
    <LI>Representing Space In Graphical Worlds </B></I></FONT><FONT size=2>
    <P align=justify>The examples above are violent action games or simulations 
    rather than social spaces, but they represent the two basic approaches to 
    the representation of worlds. The 2D approach of <I>Alone In The Dark</I> is 
    almost MUD-like in that space is represented by a collection of discrete 
    scenes. Each fixed background image represents a "camera shot" of some part 
    of the space, and while the avatar can be moved around, at some point, there 
    may be a transition from one scene to another. An advantage of this 
    representation is computationally cheap rendering. Only the avatars really 
    need to be rendered at full frame rates, while in a 3D, first-person 
    environment, the entire screen can change while the player moves. Memory 
    usage depends on the quality of the 2D backgrounds and how many viewpoints 
    of the space are allowed.</P>
    <P align=justify>Authoring this type of 2D representation requires planning 
    and drawing perspective art. In the case of <I>Alone In The Dark</I>, this 
    clearly required professional artists. An interesting alternative is 
    demonstrated by the game, <I>MYST</I>, in which the authors built a 3D model 
    and used a ray tracer to automatically generate perfectly consistent and 
    correct 2D perspective scenes. In a full 3D game, this is taken to the 
    extreme of authoring a 3D model and rendering perspective scenes in real 
    time from any viewpoint the user desires.</P>
    <P align=justify>Full 3D virtual space requires a continuous representation 
    of 3D geometry, rather than a discrete set of 2D views. Given the current 
    state of the art in real-time rendering on PCs, there are two feasible 
    representations for objects and space: texture mapped polygons, and voxel 
    height fields. The latter is a specialized technique used by some games for 
    outdoor terrain, although <I>Magic Carpet</I> actually uses textured 
    polygons for terrain. A special case of texture mapping is the use of 
    environment maps for distant features like sky or mountains. The "outdoor 
    engine" in the new game, <I>Terra Nova</I>, blends between these three 
    methods, using polygons for nearby features, voxels for medium-distance 
    terrain, and environment maps for everything beyond.</P>
    <P align=justify>Much of the richness of a 3D environment can be captured by 
    a 2D floor-plan model, as demonstrated by <I>DOOM</I>. In this approach, the 
    world is treated as a one-story building with vertical walls, sections of 
    floor of varying heights, and an optional ceiling. This paradigm is 
    sufficient to model stairs, tiered courtyards, pedestals, pools, windows and 
    skylights. Because it is easier to author than general 3D models, 
    considerable content for <I>DOOM</I> has been authored by some enthusiastic 
    end users.</P>
    <P align=center><IMG height=481 src="Papers_95vworlds_Image64.jpg" 
    width=456></P>
    <P align=center>A typical DOOM floor plan</P>
    <P align=justify>Unfortunately, games like <I>DOOM</I> have very 
    purposefully modeled spaces that are full of tension and threat; walls 
    riddled by bullet holes or splashed with blood, dimly lit corridors, hidden 
    doors, and confusing mazes. These games demonstrate promising new 
    technology, but they have the wrong esthetics for social 
    spaces.</P></FONT><B><I><FONT face=Arial size=4>

  size=2>
  <P align=justify>What will people do in a virtual world, and how can graphics 
  enhance their experience beyond what is found in MUDs? This is a poorly 
  understood problem. We know what people do on MUDs: explore, build, play 
  games, fantasize sexually, and chat. From this emerges friendships, feuds, 
  politics, artwork, and community. It is difficult to even speculate how 
  graphics or other media might enable entirely new experiences and behavior, 
  hitherto unseen on MUDs. The immediate goal is to improve the quality of the 
  user’s experience.</P>
  <P align=justify>New users typically engage in exploration, learning what the 
  virtual space contains and deciding whether or not to invest time there. This 
  seems like the most obvious opportunity for graphics. First-person full 3D 
  spaces quickly immerse the user and give the thrill of motion and discovery. 
  Seeing into the distance can give an overview, as can explicit maps. In 
  third-person views, navigating the player around an area is clumsy (an 
  annoying feature of games like <I>Alone In The Dark</I>), but clicking on 
  destinations seems to work well (as LucasArts’ games demonstrate). Full 3D 
  representation of space gives the user a greater sense of motion and freedom, 
  allowing them to approach and inspect any object that interests them or to 
  look around corners and behind things. 2D backgrounds and the texture images 
  mapped on surfaces in 3D can be interesting and high quality, since they are 
  rendered or painted off line.</P>
  <P align=justify>The representation of the user’s virtual body can also be 2D 
  or 3D. Little can be said with certainty today about which provides a greater 
  sense of immersion or embodiment. 2D avatars may be easier for end users to 
  author, perhaps by scanning in photos or drawings. Gesture and animation of 2D 
  avatars requires storing different poses and aspects. 3D avatars can be more 
  easily animated, and a single model can be transformed into different poses or 
  seen from any direction. It may be more difficult to author 3D avatars, and 
  perhaps difficult to overcome the esthetics of polygonal shapes. Sega’s game, 
  <I>Virtua Fighter</I>, gives an example of human figures modeled with a fairly 
  small number of texture-mapped polygons:</P><I>
  <P align=center><IMG height=327 src="Papers_95vworlds_Image65.jpg"

  <P align=center>Polygonal avatars from <I>Virtua Fighter</P></I>
  <P align=justify>In a recent survey of users on LambdaMOO, people reported 
  that 57 percent of their time was spent socializing; which is to say, 
  communicating with other users. Live audio would allow users to speak 
  directly, although with more than two users communicating at a time, scrolling 
  text enables complex multi-threaded conversations without the problems of 
  users interrupting each other. This report has neglected the subject of audio, 
  but clearly, speech, sound effects, and music are important additions to a 
  virtual world. But it seems likely that the first virtual worlds will be based 
  on text with graphics.</P>
  <P align=justify>When asked about graphics. most MUD users have a hard time 
  thinking of much that it can do to improve their experience. Avatar gestures 
  and facial expressions can augment communication and replace some of the 
  simplest uses of emoting on MUDs, but it seems unlikely that the elaborate 
  moods, thoughts and actions of emoting could be expressed graphically. 
  Graphics can certainly set a mood, just as rooms on MUDs do. Finally, knowing 
  who is present at a location is clearly illustrated by a visual display. On 
  MUDs, users frequently type "LOOK" or "@CROWD" just to remind themselves of 
  who is present in a room.</P>
  <P align=justify>There are some reasons to think that a third-person view 
  would be best for group communication, because it gives a wider angle of view 
  that can include everyone, and it allows the user to see their own avatar in 
  context, just as one sees their own emotes on a MUD.</P>
  <P align=center><IMG height=386 src="Papers_95vworlds_Image66.jpg" 
  width=512></P>
  <P align=center>A scene from <I>Worlds Away</P></I>
  <P align=justify>Lucasfilm’s <I>Habitat</I> system, and the current version of 
  it called <I>Worlds Away</I> gives a fascinating example of a social space 
  enhanced with graphics. Their system uses 2D graphics, sound effects, and 
  textual communication. As illustrated above, a scrolling MUD-like text windows 
  is cleverly combined with aspects of the comic-book speech balloon. The bodies 
  can turn and sit, and the heads can have versions that display expression. 
  Because the settings have a fairly limited 2D view, it is easy to spatially 
  associate speech with a player by printing it above them and displaying an 
  arrow (as seen above) to the most recent user to talk. In a full 3D world, 
  connecting speech with players is more difficult. The first solution that 
  comes to mind is to simply have a scrolling MUD-like text window below the 
  graphics display.</P>
  <P align=justify>Conspicuously absent from <I>Worlds Away</I> is the ability 
  to emote. The user can "say" or "think" something, but they cannot narrate an 
  arbitrary action or statement. Emoting is a dilemma. As in combat adventure 
  MUDs, allowing the user to emote could create inconsistency. Graphics cannot 
  visually display complex actions that might be implied by emoting. Should the 
  inconsistency be allowed, or should user communication be restricted?</P>
  <P align=justify>Combat adventure MUDs have many special-purpose commands 
  instead of general emoting. These commands implement fighting and game play, 
  and even on social MUDs, commands like "take", "drop", or "go" actually do 
  perform an action. Emoting does not perform an action on the world, but simply 
  describes an imaginary action. In a graphically displayed world, as many 
  actions as possible should be animated to give a sense of efficacy, giving the 
  user a sense of acting in and upon the world.</P>
  <P align=justify>I believe emoting is too important and expressive to be 
  disallowed. Users will find their own idioms of communication, and if emoting 
  is not allowed, they may simply invent a convention of speech to implement it. 
  I would advocate giving the user various channels of communication. Different 
  commands could say or emote as in a MUD. Other commands might place text into 
  a balloon over their head or into a narration box in the upper left corner of 
  the frame. Given a various means of expression, no doubt new styles of 
  communication will emerge.</P></FONT><B><FONT face=Arial size=5>
  <LI>Conclusions</LI></OL></B></FONT><FONT size=2>
<P align=justify>MUDs can immerse users in an imaginary world described with 
text. They provide a persistent space that can be explored, changed and 
constructed by users. They create an embodiment of the user in the virtual 
world, into which they can project their agency and meet other users. The first 
MUDs were thought of as games or "interactive fiction", but they have evolved 
well beyond those notions into complex social environments.</P>
<P align=justify>Adding graphics to MUDs is technically feasible, and in theory 
it should be able to replace some of the burdensome aspects of reading text with 
a more direct sensory experience. Visualizing and exploring the virtual world is 
clearly enhanced by graphics, but adding a graphical component to communication 
is a subtler problem. First-person viewpoint, like DOOM, works well for 
exploration. When communicating, users may want to switch to a third-person view 
that shows them and their gestures in context with others.</P>
<P align=justify>Current graphical VR proposals like VRML have focused only on 
rendering and geometrical modeling, which may not be the hardest or most 
important problems. VR is more than a "3D document". In a distributed multi-user 
environment, it is important to make the models dynamic, allowing motion and 
updates to geometry. Difficult problems of distributed cache consistancy and 
updating replicated data must be addressed in order for the system to scale up 
to large numbers of users. Finally, there is the problem of user interface 
design; allowing users to communicate with each other, navigate in the space and 
interact with objects. Experience with MUDs provides some clues to how virtual 
spaces should be structured and how users will interface with them.</P>
