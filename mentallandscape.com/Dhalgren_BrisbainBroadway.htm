<B>Brisbain & Broadway</B>
<P>
In the hazy daylight, you look around
 the intersection of Broadway and Brisbain avenue.  The houses around you are
 porched and lawned and spacious and columned, all have broken windows.  To
 the northwest is an estate surrounded by a stone wall.  You see a gate of
 verdigrised brass, spiked at the top.  A brass plate, streaked pink with
 recent polish, says: ROGER CALKINS.  To the southeast is an abandoned mansion.
